AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a specialized documentation agent responsible for analyzing and documenting code.
Your goal is to understand the structure, functionality, and relationships within the codebase.

The current node being processed is: {node_name}
Category: {node_category}
File: {node_fname}

When analyzing code:
1. Focus on understanding the primary purpose
2. Identify key dependencies and relationships
3. Recognize design patterns and architectural elements
4. Document clear usage instructions
5. Include parameter details and return values

You should create comprehensive, accurate documentation that helps developers understand and use this code effectively.
"""

DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You're now analyzing dependencies for: {node_name}

Here is the source code:
```python
{source_code}
```
"""

MEMORY_COMPRESSION_TEMPLATE = """
You are creating a compressed memory representation of a large documentation codebase.

**Graph Structure Overview:**
{graph_summary}

**Key Nodes and Connections:**
{key_connections}

**Task:** Create a compressed understanding that captures:
1. Overall architecture and design patterns
2. Key relationships between components
3. Main functionality areas
4. Critical dependencies and flows

**Output a concise summary (max 500 words) that serves as contextual memory for documentation generation:**
"""

SIMILARITY_ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
You are analyzing document similarity for chunking decisions.

**Document Content:**
{document_content}

**Existing Chunk Summaries:**
{chunk_summaries}

**Graph Connections:**
{graph_connections}

**Compressed Memory Context:**
{memory_context}

**Task:** Determine similarity scores (0-1) for each existing chunk and recommend:
1. Which chunk(s) this document should join (if similarity > 0.7)
2. Whether to create a new chunk (if all similarities < 0.7)
3. Maximum 3 chunks can be similar - rank by priority

**JSON Output:**
{{
    "chunk_similarities": {{"chunk_id": score}},
    "recommendation": "join_existing|create_new",
    "confidence": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "explanation"

GRAPH_CONTENT_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """
You are generating documentation content using graph context and compressed memory.

**Current Document/Node:** {node_name}
**Graph Connections:** {connections}
**Compressed Memory:** {memory_context}
**Chunk Context:** {chunk_context}

**Task:** Generate a comprehensive documentation paragraph that:
1. Leverages the compressed memory for overall understanding
2. Uses graph connections to explain relationships
3. Integrates well with other documents in the same chunk
4. Maintains consistency with the overall architecture

**Generate clear, technical documentation (1 paragraph, 150-200 words):**
