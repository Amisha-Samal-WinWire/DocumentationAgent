### Module: `DataService`

The `DataService` class is responsible for managing data retrieval operations from a SQLite database. It provides a method to execute SQL queries and return the results in a structured format, specifically as a Pandas DataFrame. This functionality is essential for applications that require data manipulation and analysis using SQL databases.

#### Class Structure

- **Dependencies**: The `DataService` class relies on the `sqlite3` module for database connections and the Pandas library for data manipulation.

#### Key Functions

- **`get_dataframe_from_sqlite`**: 
  - This method retrieves data from a specified SQLite database using a provided SQL query and returns the results as a Pandas DataFrame.

##### Parameters and Return Values

| Parameter          | Type       | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `database`         | `str`      | The path to the SQLite database file.                       |
| `query`            | `str`      | The SQL query to be executed against the database.          |

##### Return Values

| Return Value       | Type       | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DataFrame`        | `pd.DataFrame` | A Pandas DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. |

#### Implementation Details

The `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method follows a structured approach to connect to the SQLite database, execute the SQL query, and return the results. It utilizes the `sqlite3.connect` function to establish a connection to the database and the `pd.read_sql_query` function to execute the SQL command and fetch the results as a DataFrame. Finally, it ensures that the database connection is properly closed using `conn.close()` to prevent resource leaks.

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

class DataService:
    @staticmethod
    def get_dataframe_from_sqlite(database: str, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """
        Retrieves data from a SQLite database and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame.

        Parameters:
        - database (str): The path to the SQLite database file.
        - query (str): The SQL query to be executed against the database.

        Returns:
        - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query.
        """
        # Establish a connection to the SQLite database
        conn = sqlite3.connect(database)
        try:
            # Execute the SQL query and return the results as a DataFrame
            df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
        finally:
            # Ensure the connection is closed to prevent resource leaks
            conn.close()
        
        return df
```

### Related Components

The `DataService` class is closely related to various utilities and components that facilitate data retrieval and manipulation within the application. It is particularly relevant in the context of database interactions and data analysis.

| Component Name                       | Summary                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sqlite3.connect`                   | Establishes and manages a connection to a SQLite database, allowing for SQL command execution and data management. |
| `pd.read_sql_query`                 | Executes SQL queries against a database and returns the results as a Pandas DataFrame.    |
| `conn.close`                        | Terminates a connection to a resource and releases associated resources to prevent memory leaks. |

### Method: `get_series_from_file`

The `get_series_from_file` method is designed to read a series of data from a specified file, typically in CSV format, and return it as a Pandas Series. This method is crucial for applications that require data ingestion from external files for analysis or processing.

#### Implementation Details

The method utilizes the `pd.read_csv` function from the Pandas library to read the contents of the file. It may also leverage `StringIO` for handling in-memory string data, allowing for efficient file-like operations without the need for actual file I/O.

```python
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

class DataService:
    @staticmethod
    def get_series_from_file(filepath: str) -> pd.Series:
        """
        Reads a series from a specified CSV file and returns it as a Pandas Series.

        Parameters:
        - filepath (str): The path to the CSV file.

        Returns:
        - pd.Series: A Series containing the data read from the CSV file.
        """
        # Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
        df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
        # Convert the desired column to a Series (assuming the first column is of interest)
        return df.iloc[:, 0]  # Adjust as necessary for specific column selection
```

### Related Components

The `get_series_from_file` method is closely related to utilities that facilitate data reading and manipulation.

| Component Name                       | Summary                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pd.read_csv`                       | Reads CSV files and converts them into Pandas DataFrames for data analysis.                |
| `StringIO`                          | Facilitates efficient reading and writing of string data in memory, simulating file-like operations. |

The `get_series_from_file` method enhances the `DataService` class's capability to ingest data from external sources, providing a seamless way to read and process CSV files for further analysis and manipulation.
