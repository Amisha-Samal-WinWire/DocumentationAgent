### Module: `financial_service.py`

The `FinancialService` class is designed to facilitate various financial calculations, including future values, present values, and periodic payments. It leverages the `numpy_financial` library to perform these calculations efficiently and accurately.

#### Class Structure

- **Dependencies**: The `FinancialService` class relies on the `numpy_financial` library, which provides essential financial functions such as `fv`, `pv`, and `pmt`.

#### Key Functions

- **`calculate_future_value`**: 
  - This method calculates the future value of an investment based on periodic payments and a constant interest rate.

- **`calculate_present_value`**: 
  - This method computes the present value of future cash flows based on specified financial parameters.

- **`calculate_periodic_payment`**: 
  - This method determines the fixed periodic payment required to achieve a specified future value based on present value, interest rate, and number of periods.

#### Implementation Details

The `calculate_future_value` method utilizes the `npf.fv` function from the `numpy_financial` library to compute the future value based on the provided parameters.

```python
import numpy_financial as npf

class FinancialService:
    def calculate_future_value(self, rate: float, nper: int, pmt: float, pv: float = 0, when: str = 'end') -> float:
        """
        Calculates the future value of an investment based on periodic payments.

        Parameters:
        - rate (float): The interest rate per period.
        - nper (int): The total number of payment periods.
        - pmt (float): The payment made each period.
        - pv (float): The present value (default is 0).
        - when (str): Indicates when payments are due ('end' or 'begin').

        Returns:
        - float: The calculated future value of the investment.
        """
        return npf.fv(rate, nper, pmt, pv, when)
```

The `calculate_present_value` method employs the `npf.pv` function to determine the present value of future cash flows.

```python
class FinancialService:
    def calculate_present_value(self, rate: float, nper: int, pmt: float, fv: float = 0, when: str = 'end') -> float:
        """
        Calculates the present value of future cash flows.

        Parameters:
        - rate (float): The interest rate per period.
        - nper (int): The total number of payment periods.
        - pmt (float): The payment made each period.
        - fv (float): The future value (default is 0).
        - when (str): Indicates when payments are due ('end' or 'begin').

        Returns:
        - float: The calculated present value of future cash flows.
        """
        return npf.pv(rate, nper, pmt, fv, when)
```

The `calculate_periodic_payment` method calculates the fixed periodic payment required to achieve a specified future value.

```python
class FinancialService:
    def calculate_periodic_payment(self, rate: float, nper: int, pv: float, fv: float = 0.0, when: str = 'end') -> float:
        """
        Calculates the fixed periodic payment required to achieve a specified future value.

        Parameters:
        - rate (float): The interest rate per period.
        - nper (int): The total number of payment periods.
        - pv (float): The present value.
        - fv (float): The future value (default is 0).
        - when (str): Indicates when payments are due ('end' or 'begin').

        Returns:
        - float: The calculated fixed periodic payment required.
        """
        return npf.pmt(rate, nper, pv, fv, when)
```
