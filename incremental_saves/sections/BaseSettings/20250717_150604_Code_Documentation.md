### Module: `BaseSettings`

The `BaseSettings` class is a crucial component within the application, designed to manage application settings loaded from environment variables. It ensures consistent and reliable access to configuration values, facilitating the configuration management process across the application.

#### Class Structure

- **Inheritance**: 
  - The `BaseSettings` class is intended to be extended by other configuration classes, such as `Settings`. This inheritance allows derived classes to utilize the core functionalities defined in `BaseSettings`, promoting code reuse and consistency in configuration handling.

#### Key Functions

- **`load_settings`**: 
  - This method is responsible for loading configuration settings from environment variables. It ensures that the application retrieves the necessary settings in a reliable manner.

- **`get_setting`**: 
  - Retrieves a specific configuration value based on a provided key. This function abstracts the access to environment variables, allowing for a more manageable configuration retrieval process.

- **`validate_settings`**: 
  - Validates the loaded settings against predefined constraints to ensure that all required configuration values are present and correctly formatted.

##### Parameters and Return Values

| Parameter      | Type   | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`          | `str`  | The key of the setting to retrieve.                          |
| `default`      | `Any`  | The default value to return if the setting is not found.    |

#### Implementation Details

The `BaseSettings` class is structured to provide a robust foundation for managing application settings. By encapsulating the logic for loading and validating configuration values, it simplifies the process of configuration management for derived classes.

```python
class BaseSettings:
    def load_settings(self):
        """
        Loads configuration settings from environment variables.

        Returns:
        - dict: A dictionary containing the loaded settings.
        """
        # Implementation of loading logic
        pass

    def get_setting(self, key, default=None):
        """
        Retrieves a specific configuration value.

        Parameters:
        - key (str): The key of the setting to retrieve.
        - default (Any): The default value to return if the setting is not found.

        Returns:
        - Any: The value of the setting or the default value.
        """
        # Implementation of retrieval logic
        pass

    def validate_settings(self):
        """
        Validates the loaded settings against predefined constraints.

        Returns:
        - bool: True if all settings are valid, False otherwise.
        """
        # Implementation of validation logic
        pass
```
