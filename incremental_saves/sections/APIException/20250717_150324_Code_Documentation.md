### Module: `APIException`

The `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur within the API layer of the application. It extends the base `Exception` class, allowing for the creation of specific error messages and handling mechanisms that are relevant to API operations.

#### Class Structure

- **Inheritance**: 
  - Inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, which serves as the foundational class for all built-in exceptions in Python.

#### Key Functions

- **`__init__`**: 
  - The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `APIException` class. It sets up the initial state of the exception, allowing for custom error messages and additional context to be provided when the exception is raised.

#### Implementation Details

The `APIException` class is structured to provide a clear and concise way to manage errors that arise during API interactions. By extending the base `Exception` class, it allows developers to create specific exceptions that can be caught and handled appropriately in the API layer.

```python
class APIException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str, status_code: int = 500):
        """
        Initializes the APIException with a custom message and status code.

        Parameters:
        - message (str): The error message to be displayed.
        - status_code (int): The HTTP status code associated with the error (default is 500).
        """
        super().__init__(message)
        self.status_code = status_code
```

### Related Components

The `APIException` class is relevant to several API endpoints that handle various statistical computations and data processing tasks. These endpoints include:

| Endpoint Name               | Summary                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `perform_regression`        | Handles POST requests to perform Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis and returns the results. |
| `get_descriptive_stats`     | Handles POST requests to compute and return descriptive statistics for a given dataset.    |
| `get_confidence_interval`   | Handles HTTP POST requests to calculate and return the confidence interval for a given dataset. |
| `get_z_scores`             | Handles HTTP POST requests to calculate z-scores for a given dataset.                     |
| `calculate_loan_payment`    | Calculates the periodic payment required to amortize a loan based on interest rate, number of periods, and present value. |

### Error Handling

The `APIException` class can be utilized within the aforementioned API endpoints to manage errors effectively. For instance, if an error occurs during data processing in `perform_regression`, an instance of `APIException` can be raised with a relevant message and status code, allowing for consistent error handling across the API.

```python
def perform_regression(data):
    try:
        # Perform regression analysis
        pass  # Implementation details here
    except SomeSpecificError as e:
        raise APIException("Error performing regression analysis: " + str(e), status_code=400)
```

This structured approach to error handling ensures that the API can communicate issues clearly to clients, facilitating better debugging and user experience.
