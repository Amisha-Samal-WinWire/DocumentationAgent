### Module: `APIException`

The `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that may arise during the execution of API-related operations. This class extends the base `Exception` class, allowing for the creation of specific error types that can be raised and caught in a controlled manner. 

#### Class Structure
- **Inheritance**: The `APIException` class inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class, which serves as the foundational class for all built-in exceptions. This inheritance allows `APIException` to be used in standard exception handling constructs.

#### Key Functions
The `APIException` class may include the following key functions, although specific implementations are not provided in the documentation:

- **`__init__`**: This method initializes a new instance of the `APIException` class. It sets up the initial state of the exception, potentially accepting parameters that provide context about the error.

#### Implementation Details
The `APIException` class is likely designed to encapsulate error messages and codes that are relevant to API operations. This allows developers to provide more informative error responses to clients consuming the API.

### Example Code Snippet
Here is an example of how the `APIException` class might be implemented:

```python
class APIException(Exception):
    """Custom exception class for API errors."""
    
    def __init__(self, message: str, status_code: int = 500):
        """
        Initializes the APIException with a message and an optional status code.

        Parameters:
        - message (str): The error message to be displayed.
        - status_code (int): The HTTP status code associated with the error (default is 500).
        """
        super().__init__(message)
        self.status_code = status_code
```
