### Module: `APIException`

The `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur within the API layer of the application. It extends the base `Exception` class, allowing for the creation of specific error messages and handling mechanisms that are relevant to API operations.

#### Class Structure

- **Inheritance**: 
  - Inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, which serves as the foundational class for all built-in exceptions in Python.

#### Key Functions

- **`__init__`**: 
  - The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `APIException` class. It sets up the initial state of the exception, allowing for custom error messages and additional context to be provided when the exception is raised.

##### Parameters and Return Values

| Parameter      | Type   | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `message`      | `str`  | The error message to be displayed.                           |
| `status_code`  | `int`  | The HTTP status code associated with the error (default is 500). |

#### Implementation Details

The `APIException` class is structured to provide a clear and concise way to manage errors that arise during API interactions. By extending the base `Exception` class, it allows developers to create specific exceptions that can be caught and handled appropriately in the API layer.

```python
class APIException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str, status_code: int = 500):
        """
        Initializes the APIException with a custom message and status code.

        Parameters:
        - message (str): The error message to be displayed.
        - status_code (int): The HTTP status code associated with the error (default is 500).
        """
        super().__init__(message)
        self.status_code = status_code
```

### Related Components

The `APIException` class is relevant to several API endpoints that handle various statistical computations and data processing tasks. These endpoints include:

| Endpoint Name               | Summary                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `perform_regression`        | Handles POST requests to perform Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis and returns the results. |
| `get_descriptive_stats`     | Handles POST requests to compute and return descriptive statistics for a given dataset.    |
| `get_confidence_interval`   | Handles HTTP POST requests to calculate and return the confidence interval for a given dataset. |
| `get_z_scores`             | Handles HTTP POST requests to calculate z-scores for a given dataset.                     |
| `calculate_loan_payment`    | Calculates the periodic payment required to amortize a loan based on interest rate, number of periods, and present value. |

### Error Handling

The `APIException` class can be utilized within the aforementioned API endpoints to manage errors effectively. For instance, if an error occurs during data processing in `perform_regression`, an instance of `APIException` can be raised with a relevant message and status code, allowing for consistent error handling across the API.

```python
def perform_regression(data):
    try:
        # Perform regression analysis
        pass  # Implementation details here
    except SomeSpecificError as e:
        raise APIException("Error performing regression analysis: " + str(e), status_code=400)
```

This structured approach to error handling ensures that the API can communicate issues clearly to clients, facilitating better debugging and user experience.

### Module: `APIRouter`

The `APIRouter` class is a core component of the FastAPI framework, designed to facilitate the routing of API requests to their corresponding handler functions. It provides a structured way to define and manage API endpoints, ensuring that requests are processed efficiently and correctly.

#### Class Structure

- **Inheritance**: 
  - Inherits from FastAPI's `APIRouter`, which allows for the creation of modular and organized API routes.

#### Key Functions

- **`include_router`**: 
  - This function allows the inclusion of other routers into the main application router, enabling a modular approach to API design.

- **`add_api_route`**: 
  - This function is used to define a new API route, specifying the HTTP method, path, and handler function.

- **`get`**, **`post`**, **`put`**, **`delete`**: 
  - These methods are shorthand for defining routes for the respective HTTP methods, simplifying the process of creating endpoints.

##### Parameters and Return Values

| Parameter      | Type   | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path`         | `str`  | The URL path for the API endpoint.                          |
| `endpoint`     | `callable` | The function that will handle requests to this endpoint.  |
| `methods`      | `list` | A list of HTTP methods (e.g., `["GET", "POST"]`) that this route will respond to. |

#### Implementation Details

The `APIRouter` class is designed to streamline the process of defining API routes within a FastAPI application. By allowing developers to group related endpoints together, it enhances code organization and maintainability. The router can be included in the main application, enabling a clear separation of concerns.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    """
    Retrieve an item by its ID.

    Parameters:
    - item_id (int): The ID of the item to retrieve.

    Returns:
    - dict: The item details.
    """
    return {"item_id": item_id}

@router.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: dict):
    """
    Create a new item.

    Parameters:
    - item (dict): The item details to create.

    Returns:
    - dict: The created item details.
    """
    return {"item": item}
```

### Related Components

The `APIRouter` is closely related to the following components within the FastAPI application:

| Component Name               | Summary                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app\api\v1\api.py`         | Facilitates the routing of API requests to their corresponding handler functions within a FastAPI application. |
| `app\api\v1\endpoints\statistics.py` | Defines and manages the API endpoints for retrieving and processing statistical data. |

This modular approach to API design using `APIRouter` allows for better scalability and maintainability of the application, making it easier to manage complex routing logic as the application grows.
