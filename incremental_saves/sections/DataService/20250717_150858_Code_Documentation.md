### Module: `DataError`

The `DataError` class is designed to encapsulate error handling related to data processing within the application. It serves as a custom exception type that can be raised during various data validation and processing operations, providing a structured way to manage errors that arise from data inconsistencies or invalid inputs.

#### Class Structure

- **Inheritance**: 
  - The `DataError` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, allowing it to function as a standard exception while also providing additional context specific to data-related issues.

#### Key Functions

- **`__init__`**: 
  - This constructor method initializes a new instance of `DataError`, allowing for custom error messages and additional context to be passed when the exception is raised.

##### Parameters and Return Values

| Parameter          | Type       | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `message`          | `str`      | A custom error message that describes the data error.       |
| `data_context`     | `dict`     | Optional additional context about the data that caused the error. |

##### Return Values

| Return Value       | Type       | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `None`             | `NoneType` | The constructor does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance. |

#### Implementation Details

The `DataError` class is structured to provide a clear and informative way to handle errors related to data processing. By extending the `Exception` class, it allows for the creation of exceptions that can be caught and handled specifically in the context of data validation and processing.

The `__init__` method allows for the inclusion of a custom error message and optional data context, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes. This additional context can help developers understand the circumstances under which the error occurred, facilitating easier troubleshooting.

```python
class DataError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, data_context=None):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of DataError.

        Parameters:
        - message (str): A custom error message that describes the data error.
        - data_context (dict, optional): Additional context about the data that caused the error.
        """
        super().__init__(message)
        self.data_context = data_context
```

### Related Components

The `DataError` class is closely related to various services and components that handle data processing and validation within the application. It is particularly relevant in the context of error handling during data validation and regression analysis.

| Component Name                       | Summary                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DataService.get_series_from_file`   | Reads a CSV file, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a Pandas Series.        |
| `ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs` | Validates input data for regression analysis by checking column existence, data type, and null values. |
| `ValidationService`                  | Performs complex validations on data inputs to ensure they meet business rules and data integrity requirements. |
| `APIException`                       | Defines a custom exception type for structured error handling in the API framework.        |

The `DataError` class enhances the application's robustness by providing a dedicated mechanism for managing data-related errors, thereby improving the overall reliability and maintainability of the codebase.
