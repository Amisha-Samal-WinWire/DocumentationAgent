### Implementation View

This section provides a detailed analysis of the `FinancialService` component within the application, focusing on its implementation details, deployment patterns, runtime behavior, and technical specifications.

### FinancialService Overview

The `FinancialService` is a utility module designed to facilitate various financial calculations, including future values, present values, and periodic payments. It leverages the `numpy_financial` library to perform these calculations, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in financial computations.

### Implementation Details

The `FinancialService` is implemented in the following connected components:

1. **Financial Calculations**:
   - **Location**: `app\services\financial_service.py::module_code`
   - **Functionality**: This module encapsulates the core functionalities of the `FinancialService` class, providing methods for calculating future values, present values, and periodic payments. It serves as a utility for financial operations, enhancing the application's capability to handle financial data.

2. **Future Value Calculation**:
   - **Utility**: `npf.fv`
   - **Functionality**: This utility function calculates the future value of an investment based on periodic payments and a constant interest rate. It is essential for determining the potential growth of investments over time.
   - **Documentation**: 
     ```python
     npf.fv(rate: float, nper: int, pmt: float, pv: float = 0, when: str = 'end') -> float
     ```

3. **Present Value Calculation**:
   - **Utility**: `npf.pv`
   - **Functionality**: This utility function calculates the present value of future cash flows based on specified financial parameters. It is crucial for assessing the current worth of future cash flows.
   - **Documentation**: 
     ```python
     npf.pv(rate: float, nper: int, pmt: float, fv: float = 0, when: str = 'end') -> float
     ```

4. **Periodic Payment Calculation**:
   - **Utility**: `npf.pmt`
   - **Functionality**: This utility function calculates the fixed periodic payment required to achieve a specified future value based on present value, interest rate, and number of periods. It is vital for loan and investment planning.
   - **Documentation**: 
     ```python
     npf.pmt(rate: float, nper: int, pv: float, fv: float = 0.0, when: str = 'end') -> float
     ```

### Deployment Patterns

The deployment of the `FinancialService` typically follows these patterns:

- **Containerization**: The application can be containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments. The `Dockerfile` would include the necessary configurations to install the `numpy_financial` library along with other dependencies.

- **Cloud Deployment**: The application can be deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. This often involves setting up a web server (e.g., Uvicorn or Gunicorn) to serve the application, along with configuring load balancers and auto-scaling groups to handle varying traffic loads.

### Runtime Behavior

During runtime, the `FinancialService` processes financial calculations as follows:

1. **Method Invocation**: When a financial calculation is requested, the corresponding method from the `FinancialService` class is invoked. This could be a request for future value, present value, or periodic payment.

2. **Calculation Execution**: The invoked method utilizes the appropriate utility function from the `numpy_financial` library to perform the calculation. The parameters provided by the user are passed to the utility function.

3. **Result Generation**: After executing the calculation, the method generates a result, which is then returned to the caller. This result can be used for further processing or displayed to the user.
