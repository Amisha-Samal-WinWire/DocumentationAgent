### Module: `CorrelationInput`

The `CorrelationInput` class is designed to encapsulate the logic and data necessary for calculating correlation coefficients in statistical analyses. It serves as a specialized input model that extends the foundational capabilities provided by the `BaseModel`, ensuring that all necessary attributes and methods for correlation calculations are present.

#### Class Structure

- **Inheritance**: 
  - The `CorrelationInput` class inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides common functionality and attributes for derived models. This relationship allows `CorrelationInput` to leverage shared methods and properties, promoting code reuse and consistency across the application.

#### Key Functions

- **`__init__`**: 
  - This constructor method initializes a new instance of `CorrelationInput`, setting up the necessary parameters for correlation calculations.

- **`calculate_correlation`**: 
  - This method computes the correlation coefficient based on the provided datasets.

##### Parameters and Return Values

| Parameter          | Type       | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `data_x`          | `list`     | A list of numerical values representing the first dataset.   |
| `data_y`          | `list`     | A list of numerical values representing the second dataset.  |

##### Return Values

| Return Value       | Type       | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `correlation`      | `float`    | A float representing the correlation coefficient between the two datasets. |

#### Implementation Details

The `CorrelationInput` class is structured to facilitate the calculation of correlation coefficients by encapsulating the necessary data and methods. By extending the `BaseModel`, it inherits common attributes and methods, which simplifies the implementation and enhances maintainability. The `calculate_correlation` method utilizes statistical algorithms to compute the correlation coefficient based on the input datasets.

```python
class CorrelationInput(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self, data_x, data_y):
        """
        Initializes a new instance of CorrelationInput.

        Parameters:
        - data_x (list): A list of numerical values representing the first dataset.
        - data_y (list): A list of numerical values representing the second dataset.
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.data_x = data_x
        self.data_y = data_y

    def calculate_correlation(self):
        """
        Calculates the correlation coefficient for the provided datasets.

        Returns:
        - float: A float representing the correlation coefficient between the two datasets.
        """
        # Implementation of correlation calculation logic goes here
        pass
```
