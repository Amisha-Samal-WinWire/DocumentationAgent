### System Architecture

#### Overview
The architecture of the FastAPI application is designed to facilitate efficient routing of API requests and management of endpoints. Central to this architecture is the `APIRouter`, which plays a critical role in organizing and handling API interactions.

### APIRouter

#### Architectural Role
The `APIRouter` serves as a **central component** within the FastAPI application, specifically designed to facilitate the routing of API requests to their corresponding handler functions. It acts as a modular approach to defining routes, allowing for better organization and separation of concerns within the application.

- **Modularity**: By using `APIRouter`, developers can create distinct modules for different functionalities, such as user management, statistics, and other features, promoting a clean architecture.
- **Scalability**: The router can be easily extended with new endpoints, making it suitable for applications that anticipate growth or changes in functionality.

#### Design Patterns
The use of `APIRouter` aligns with several key design patterns:

- **Microservices**: Each router can represent a microservice, encapsulating specific functionalities and allowing for independent development and deployment.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By organizing routes into different routers, the application maintains a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain.

#### Connected Components
