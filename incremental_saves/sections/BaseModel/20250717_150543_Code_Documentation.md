### Module: `BaseModel`

The `BaseModel` class serves as a foundational data model within the application, providing essential functionalities and structure for various derived model classes. It encapsulates common attributes and methods that can be utilized by other models, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication.

#### Class Structure

- **Inheritance**: 
  - The `BaseModel` class is designed to be extended by other model classes, such as `SingleInput`, `DualInput`, `LoanPaymentInput`, and others. This inheritance allows derived classes to leverage the core functionalities defined in `BaseModel`.

#### Key Functions

- **`validate_input`**: 
  - This method is responsible for validating the input data provided to the model. It ensures that the data adheres to the expected format and constraints before any processing occurs.

- **`to_dict`**: 
  - Converts the model instance into a dictionary representation, which can be useful for serialization or logging purposes.

- **`from_dict`**: 
  - A class method that allows the creation of a model instance from a dictionary, facilitating easy initialization from external data sources.

##### Parameters and Return Values

| Parameter      | Type   | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `data`         | `dict` | The input data to be validated or converted.                |
| `model`        | `BaseModel` | An instance of the model to be populated from the dictionary. |

#### Implementation Details

The `BaseModel` class is structured to provide a robust base for various data models within the application. By encapsulating common functionalities such as input validation and data conversion, it promotes code reuse and simplifies the development of derived classes.

```python
class BaseModel:
    def validate_input(self, data):
        """
        Validates the input data against predefined constraints.

        Parameters:
        - data (dict): The input data to validate.

        Returns:
        - bool: True if the data is valid, False otherwise.
        """
        # Implementation of validation logic
        pass

    def to_dict(self):
        """
        Converts the model instance to a dictionary.

        Returns:
        - dict: The dictionary representation of the model.
        """
        # Implementation of conversion logic
        pass

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data):
        """
        Creates an instance of the model from a dictionary.

        Parameters:
        - data (dict): The input data to populate the model.

        Returns:
        - BaseModel: An instance of the model populated with the input data.
        """
        # Implementation of instance creation logic
        pass
```
