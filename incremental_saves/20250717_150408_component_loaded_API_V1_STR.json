    "Code Documentation": "### Module: `APIException`\n\nThe `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur within the API layer of the application. It extends the base `Exception` class, allowing for the creation of specific error messages and handling mechanisms that are relevant to API operations.\n\n#### Class Structure\n\n- **Inheritance**: \n  - Inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, which serves as the foundational class for all built-in exceptions in Python.\n\n#### Key Functions\n\n- **`__init__`**: \n  - The constructor method initializes a new instance of the `APIException` class. It sets up the initial state of the exception, allowing for custom error messages and additional context to be provided when the exception is raised.\n\n##### Parameters and Return Values\n\n| Parameter      | Type   | Description                                                  |\n|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `message`      | `str`  | The error message to be displayed.                           |\n| `status_code`  | `int`  | The HTTP status code associated with the error (default is 500). |\n\n#### Implementation Details\n\nThe `APIException` class is structured to provide a clear and concise way to manage errors that arise during API interactions. By extending the base `Exception` class, it allows developers to create specific exceptions that can be caught and handled appropriately in the API layer.\n\n```python\nclass APIException(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message: str, status_code: int = 500):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the APIException with a custom message and status code.\n\n        Parameters:\n        - message (str): The error message to be displayed.\n        - status_code (int): The HTTP status code associated with the error (default is 500).\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__(message)\n        self.status_code = status_code\n```\n\n### Related Components\n\nThe `APIException` class is relevant to several API endpoints that handle various statistical computations and data processing tasks. These endpoints include:\n\n| Endpoint Name               | Summary                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `perform_regression`        | Handles POST requests to perform Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis and returns the results. |\n| `get_descriptive_stats`     | Handles POST requests to compute and return descriptive statistics for a given dataset.    |\n| `get_confidence_interval`   | Handles HTTP POST requests to calculate and return the confidence interval for a given dataset. |\n| `get_z_scores`             | Handles HTTP POST requests to calculate z-scores for a given dataset.                     |\n| `calculate_loan_payment`    | Calculates the periodic payment required to amortize a loan based on interest rate, number of periods, and present value. |\n\n### Error Handling\n\nThe `APIException` class can be utilized within the aforementioned API endpoints to manage errors effectively. For instance, if an error occurs during data processing in `perform_regression`, an instance of `APIException` can be raised with a relevant message and status code, allowing for consistent error handling across the API.\n\n```python\ndef perform_regression(data):\n    try:\n        # Perform regression analysis\n        pass  # Implementation details here\n    except SomeSpecificError as e:\n        raise APIException(\"Error performing regression analysis: \" + str(e), status_code=400)\n```\n\nThis structured approach to error handling ensures that the API can communicate issues clearly to clients, facilitating better debugging and user experience.\n\n### Module: `APIRouter`\n\nThe `APIRouter` class is a core component of the FastAPI framework, designed to facilitate the routing of API requests to their corresponding handler functions.
