### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` in `age__calculator.py` is responsible for calculating the age of a person based on their birth date. It interacts with user input to gather necessary data and utilizes basic arithmetic operations to derive the age, which is then printed to the console.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module expects the user to input their birth date in a specific format (typically day, month, and year). The input should be valid and parsable to ensure accurate age calculation.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module begins by importing necessary external libraries, including `int`, `input`, and `print`, which are used for data handling and output.
- It prompts the user to enter their birth date using the `input` function.
- The input is processed to extract the birth date components (day, month, year).
- The current date is retrieved to calculate the difference between the current date and the birth date.
- The age is computed by subtracting the birth year from the current year, with adjustments made for whether the birthday has occurred yet in the current year.
- Finally, the calculated age is displayed to the user using the `print` function. 

This module serves as a straightforward utility for age calculation, leveraging user input and basic date arithmetic.
