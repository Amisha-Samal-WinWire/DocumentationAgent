# Documentation for `DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

```python
def get_dataframe_from_sqlite(self, db_path: str, table_name: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame.

    This method establishes a connection to the specified SQLite database and executes a SQL query 
    to fetch all records from the given table. It returns the results as a pandas DataFrame. 
    This function is utilized by both the ValidationService and StatsService.

    Parameters:
    - db_path (str): The file path to the SQLite database.
    - table_name (str): The name of the table to retrieve data from.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the data from the specified table.

    Raises:
    - DataError: If the database file does not exist, if the table is empty or does not exist, 
      or if any database-related error occurs during the operation.

    Example Usage:
    ```python
    try:
        data_service = DataService()
        df = data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite('path/to/database.db', 'my_table')
        print(df)
    except DataError as e:
        print(e.detail)
    ```

    Notes:
    - Ensure that the SQLite database file exists at the specified path before calling this method.
    - The method will raise a `DataError` with a descriptive message if any issues arise during execution.
    """
    if not os.path.exists(db_path):
        raise DataError(f'Database file not found at path: {db_path}')
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        query = f'SELECT * FROM "{table_name}"'
        df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
        conn.close()
        if df.empty:
            raise DataError(f"Table '{table_name}' is empty or does not exist.")
        return df
    except Exception as e:
        raise DataError(f'A database error occurred: {e}. Check table and database path.')
```
