#### Overview
The `Config` class is designed to manage configuration settings for the application. It serves as a centralized repository for accessing and modifying various parameters that control the behavior of the application.

#### Attributes
- **settings (dict)**: A dictionary that holds the configuration settings. This attribute can be populated with key-value pairs representing different configuration options.

#### Methods
- **`__init__()`**: Initializes a new instance of the `Config` class and sets up the `settings` attribute as an empty dictionary. This method allows for the addition of default settings or user-defined configurations.

#### Usage
To utilize the `Config` class, instantiate it and modify the `settings` attribute as needed. This allows for flexible configuration management throughout the application.

```python
config = Config()
config.settings['theme'] = 'dark'
config.settings['language'] = 'en'
```

This documentation provides a clear understanding of the `Config` class, its purpose, and how to use it effectively within the application.
