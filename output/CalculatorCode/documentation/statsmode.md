# Documentation for `stats.mode`

### stats.mode(data: list) -> Union[int, float]

**Description:**
The `stats.mode` function calculates the mode of a given dataset, which is the value that appears most frequently. If there are multiple modes, it returns the smallest mode. This function is useful in statistical analysis where identifying the most common value in a dataset is required.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) from which the mode will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list containing numerical values. The list can include integers and/or floats. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return a specific value indicating that no mode exists.

**Returns:**
`Union[int, float]`: The mode of the dataset, which can be either an integer or a float, depending on the input data. If there are multiple modes, the smallest mode is returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input to ensure that it is a non-empty list of numerical values.
- It then counts the occurrences of each unique value in the dataset using a frequency count.
- After counting, it identifies the maximum frequency and determines which value(s) correspond to this frequency.
- In the case of multiple values having the same maximum frequency, the function selects the smallest value among them as the mode.
- Finally, the function returns the mode value. It does not rely on any external dependencies, performing all calculations internally using basic data structures and algorithms.
