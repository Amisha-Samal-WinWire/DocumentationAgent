# Documentation for `stats.mode`

### stats.mode(data: list) -> int

**Description:**
The `stats.mode` function calculates the mode of a given dataset, which is the value that appears most frequently. If there are multiple modes, it returns the smallest mode. This function is useful in statistical analysis to identify the most common value in a dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of values (can be of any data type) from which the mode is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list containing numerical or categorical values. The function expects at least one element in the list to compute the mode. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error.

**Returns:**
`int`: The mode of the dataset, represented as the most frequently occurring value. If there are multiple modes, the smallest one is returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking the frequency of each unique value in the input list.
- It constructs a frequency distribution to count how many times each value appears.
- The function then identifies the maximum frequency from this distribution.
- If multiple values share the maximum frequency, the function selects the smallest value among them as the mode.
- The result is returned as the mode of the dataset.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and operates solely on the provided input data.
