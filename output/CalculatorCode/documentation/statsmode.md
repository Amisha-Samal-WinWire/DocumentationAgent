# Documentation for `stats.mode`

### stats.mode(data: list) -> Union[int, float]

**Description:**
The `stats.mode` function calculates the mode of a given dataset, which is the value that appears most frequently. In cases where there are multiple modes, it returns the smallest mode. This function is useful in statistical analysis to identify the most common value in a dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) from which the mode will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list containing numerical values. The list can include integers and floats, but it must not be empty. If the list contains non-numeric types, it may raise an error.

**Returns:**
`Union[int, float]`: The mode of the dataset, which is the most frequently occurring value. If there are multiple modes, the smallest one is returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input to ensure that the dataset is not empty.
- It then counts the occurrences of each unique value in the dataset using a frequency count mechanism.
- After counting, it identifies the maximum frequency and collects all values that have this frequency.
- If multiple values share the maximum frequency, the function selects the smallest value among them as the mode.
- Finally, the mode is returned as the output. This function does not rely on any external dependencies and performs all operations using basic data structures and algorithms.
