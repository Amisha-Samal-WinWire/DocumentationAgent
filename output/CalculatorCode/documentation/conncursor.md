# Documentation for `conn.cursor`

### conn.cursor()

**Description:**
The `conn.cursor()` function is a method associated with a database connection object that creates a new cursor instance. This cursor is used to interact with the database, allowing for the execution of SQL commands and retrieval of data. It serves as a conduit between the application and the database, facilitating operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

**Parameters:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- This method does not require any input parameters. It is called on an existing database connection object (`conn`), which must be properly established beforehand.

**Returns:**
`Cursor`: An instance of a cursor object that can be used to execute SQL statements and fetch data from the database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `conn.cursor()` is invoked, it initializes a new cursor object linked to the database connection represented by `conn`.
- The cursor object provides methods for executing SQL commands, such as `execute()`, `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, and others, enabling the user to perform various database operations.
- The cursor maintains the context of the database operations, including the current position in the result set and any transaction state.
- This method does not perform any database operations itself; it merely sets up the cursor for subsequent commands. The actual interaction with the database occurs through the methods called on the cursor object after its creation.
