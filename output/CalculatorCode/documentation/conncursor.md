# Documentation for `conn.cursor`

### conn.cursor()

**Description:**
The `conn.cursor()` function is a method that creates a new cursor object associated with the database connection. This cursor is used to execute SQL commands and retrieve data from the database. It acts as an intermediary between the database and the application, allowing for the execution of queries and the management of the result sets.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This method does not require any input parameters. It is called on an existing database connection object (`conn`), which must be established prior to invoking this method.

**Returns:**
`cursor`: An object representing the cursor, which can be used to execute SQL statements and fetch results.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `conn.cursor()` is called, it initializes a new cursor object that is tied to the database connection represented by `conn`.
- The cursor can then be used to execute various SQL commands, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- After executing a command, the cursor provides methods to fetch the results, such as `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, or `fetchmany()`.
- The cursor also manages the context of the database operations, including transaction control and error handling.
- This method does not perform any internal computations or logic; it simply sets up the cursor for subsequent database interactions.
