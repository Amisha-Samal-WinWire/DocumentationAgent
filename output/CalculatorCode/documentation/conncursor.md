# Documentation for `conn.cursor`

### conn.cursor()

**Description:**
The `conn.cursor()` function is a method that creates a new cursor object associated with the database connection. This cursor is used to execute SQL commands and retrieve data from the database. It acts as an intermediary between the application and the database, allowing for the execution of queries and the management of the result sets.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This function does not require any input parameters. It is called on an existing database connection object (`conn`), which must be properly established prior to invoking this method.

**Returns:**
`Cursor`: The method returns a cursor object that can be used to execute SQL statements and fetch results from the database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `conn.cursor()` is called, it initializes a new cursor instance that is linked to the database connection represented by `conn`.
- The cursor allows for the execution of SQL commands through methods such as `execute()`, `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, and others.
- The cursor maintains the state of the current position in the result set, enabling the application to navigate through the data returned by executed queries.
- This method does not perform any operations on its own but sets up the necessary environment for subsequent database interactions. It is essential for managing database transactions and executing SQL commands effectively.
