# Documentation for `LoanPaymentInput`

### LoanPaymentInput

**Description:**
`LoanPaymentInput` is a class that serves as a model for capturing and validating input data related to loan payment calculations. It inherits from the `BaseModel`, allowing it to leverage shared functionalities while defining its own specific attributes and behaviors pertinent to loan payment inputs.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `LoanPaymentInput` class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle input data related to loan payments, which may include attributes such as payment amount, interest rate, and payment frequency. Specific constraints or validation rules for these inputs are not detailed in the provided context.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; it creates an object that represents the loan payment input model.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `LoanPaymentInput` extends the functionality of `BaseModel`, which means it inherits any methods and properties defined in `BaseModel`. This allows `LoanPaymentInput` to utilize common behaviors such as validation and serialization.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic necessary for managing loan payment inputs, including potential validation of input data to ensure it meets the required criteria (e.g., non-negative values for payment amounts).
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, it can override or extend inherited methods to provide specialized behavior tailored to loan payment inputs, while maintaining a consistent interface with other models in the application.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, indicating that it operates independently and can be utilized in various contexts within the broader application without requiring additional modules or libraries.
