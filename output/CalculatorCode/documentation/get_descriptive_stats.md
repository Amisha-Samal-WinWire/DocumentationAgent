# Documentation for `get_descriptive_stats`

### get_descriptive_stats() 

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is an API endpoint designed to compute and return descriptive statistics for a given dataset. It processes incoming POST requests, extracts the relevant data from the request body, and utilizes the `calculate_descriptive_stats` function to generate a summary of statistical metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. The results are then returned in a structured format, typically as a JSON response.

**Parameters:**
- `Depends`: This function utilizes dependency injection to manage dependencies required for its operation, such as request handling and data validation.

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a POST request containing a JSON payload that includes a dataset, typically represented as a list or array of numerical values. The dataset must not be empty, as this would lead to undefined statistical measures. The request must be properly formatted to ensure successful processing.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics. The keys may include:
- `mean`: The average of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value when the dataset is sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
- `standard_deviation`: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
- `variance`: The square of the standard deviation, representing the degree of spread in the dataset.
- `min`: The smallest value in the dataset.
- `max`: The largest value in the dataset.
- `quartiles`: Values that divide the dataset into four equal parts.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by defining a POST route using the `router.post` method, which registers the endpoint for handling incoming requests.
- It extracts the dataset from the request body, ensuring that the input is validated to confirm it is not empty and contains valid numerical data.
- The function then calls `stats_svc.calculate_descriptive_stats`, passing the validated dataset to compute the various descriptive statistics.
- Upon receiving the computed statistics, the function formats the results into a dictionary and returns it as a JSON response to the client.
- If any errors occur during processing, such as invalid input or calculation issues, the function may raise an `APIException` to handle these gracefully and provide meaningful error messages. 

This function serves as a critical component of the API, enabling users to obtain statistical insights from their data efficiently.
