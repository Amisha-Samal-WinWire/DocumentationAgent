# Documentation for `get_descriptive_stats`

### get_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is designed to handle HTTP POST requests for calculating and returning descriptive statistics of a provided dataset. It serves as an API endpoint that accepts input data, processes it to compute key statistical measures, and returns the results in a structured format. This function integrates with the web framework's routing mechanism to facilitate seamless data handling and response generation.

**Parameters:**
- `Depends`: This function utilizes dependency injection to resolve necessary services or components, although specific parameters are not explicitly defined in the function signature.

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically provided in the body of the POST request. The dataset should be a non-empty list or array of numerical values (integers or floats). It is important that the input data does not contain any non-numeric entries or NaN values, as these may require preprocessing before the function can be executed.

**Returns:**
`dict`: The function returns a dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, which may include:
- `mean`: The average of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value of the dataset.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s).
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation of the dataset.
- `data_range`: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon receiving a POST request, the function first extracts the dataset from the request body.
- It then invokes the `stats_svc.calculate_descriptive_stats` function, passing the extracted dataset as an argument. This function performs the actual calculations for the descriptive statistics.
- If the dataset is valid and the calculations are successful, the resulting statistics are compiled into a dictionary format.
- The function handles any potential errors by raising an `APIException`, ensuring that meaningful error messages are returned to the client in case of invalid input or processing issues.
- Finally, the computed statistics are returned as a JSON response, providing clients with a structured summary of the data's descriptive characteristics.
