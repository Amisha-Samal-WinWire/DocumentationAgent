### get_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is designed to retrieve and compute descriptive statistics for a given dataset. It serves as an endpoint in an API, allowing clients to submit data and receive statistical insights, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. The function leverages a service layer to perform the calculations, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which descriptive statistics are to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a list containing numerical values (floats). It is expected that the list is non-empty; otherwise, the statistical calculations may not be valid. The function may also handle edge cases, such as lists with identical values, which could affect the mode calculation.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, including:
- `mean`: The average of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value when the dataset is sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
- `variance`: A measure of the data's spread.
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation, indicating how much the values deviate from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure it meets the expected criteria.
- It then calls the `calculate_descriptive_stats` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the input data to compute the required statistics.
- The results from the `StatsService` are formatted into a dictionary structure, which is then returned to the client.
- If any errors occur during processing, such as invalid data types or empty lists, the function raises an `APIException` with an appropriate status code and detail message, ensuring that clients receive clear feedback on any issues encountered.

### get_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is designed to handle HTTP POST requests for calculating and returning descriptive statistics of a provided dataset. It serves as an API endpoint that accepts input data, processes it to compute key statistical measures, and returns the results in a structured format. This function integrates with the web framework's routing mechanism to facilitate seamless data handling and response generation.

**Parameters:**
- `Depends`: This function utilizes dependency injection to resolve necessary services or components, although specific parameters are not explicitly defined in the function signature.

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically provided in the body of the POST request. The dataset should be a non-empty list or array of numerical values (integers or floats). It is important that the input data does not contain any non-numeric entries or NaN values, as these may require preprocessing before the function can be executed.

**Returns:**
`dict`: The function returns a dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, which may include:
- `mean`: The average of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value of the dataset.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s).
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation of the dataset.
- `data_range`: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon receiving a POST request, the function first extracts the dataset from the request body.
- It then invokes the `stats_svc.calculate_descriptive_stats` function, passing the extracted dataset as an argument. This function performs the actual calculations for the descriptive statistics.
- If the dataset is valid and the calculations are successful, the resulting statistics are compiled into a dictionary format.
- The function handles any potential errors by raising an `APIException`, ensuring that meaningful error messages are returned to the client in case of invalid input or processing issues.
- Finally, the computed statistics are returned as a JSON response, providing clients with a structured summary of the data's descriptive characteristics.
