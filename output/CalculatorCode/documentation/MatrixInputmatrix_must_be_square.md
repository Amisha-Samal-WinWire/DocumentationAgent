# Documentation for `MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square`

### MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square() -> None

**Description:**
The `matrix_must_be_square` method is responsible for validating that a given matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. This is a crucial check in mathematical computations involving matrices, as many operations (like matrix multiplication) require square matrices to function correctly.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects a matrix (typically a list of lists or a similar structure) to be passed to it. The matrix should be a two-dimensional array where each sub-array represents a row.
- The method does not take parameters directly; instead, it operates on an instance variable that holds the matrix data.

**Returns:**
None. If the matrix is not square, the method raises a `ValueError` to indicate the issue.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first retrieves the matrix from the instance variable.
- It checks the number of rows in the matrix using the `len` function.
- It then verifies that each row has the same length as the total number of rows, ensuring that the matrix is square.
- If the matrix fails this check, a `ValueError` is raised, providing feedback about the invalid matrix structure.
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` function to enforce the validation rules, ensuring that the input matrix meets the necessary criteria before proceeding with further operations.
