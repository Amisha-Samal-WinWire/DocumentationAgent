### MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square()

**Description:**
The `matrix_must_be_square` method is designed to validate that a given matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. This is a crucial check in mathematical computations where square matrices are required, such as in certain linear algebra operations.

**Parameters:**
- `matrix` (`list` of `list` of `float`): A two-dimensional list representing the matrix to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `matrix` should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix.
- The matrix must contain only numerical values (e.g., integers or floats).
- The method assumes that the input is a well-formed list of lists, but it will raise an error if the matrix is not square.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises a `ValueError` if the matrix is not square.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks the length of the outer list (number of rows) and compares it to the length of each inner list (number of columns).
- If the number of rows does not equal the number of columns, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the matrix must be square.
- The method utilizes the `len` function to determine the dimensions of the matrix and relies on the `ValueError` exception to handle invalid input gracefully.
- This method is typically called during the initialization or processing of matrix-related operations to ensure that subsequent calculations can proceed without errors related to matrix dimensions.

### MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square() -> None

**Description:**
The `matrix_must_be_square` method is responsible for validating that a given matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. This validation is crucial in mathematical computations where square matrices are required, such as in certain linear algebra operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects a matrix (typically a list of lists or a 2D array) as an implicit input, which is assumed to be provided in the context of the class it belongs to. The matrix should be structured such that each inner list represents a row, and all rows should have the same length.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first retrieves the number of rows in the matrix by using the `len` function on the outer list.
- It then checks if each row in the matrix has a length equal to the number of rows, ensuring that the matrix is square.
- If any row does not meet this criterion, the method raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the matrix is not square. This exception is part of Python's built-in error handling and is used to signal that the input value is inappropriate for the expected operation.
- The method relies on the `len` function to determine the lengths of the matrix and its rows, ensuring that the validation is efficient and straightforward.
