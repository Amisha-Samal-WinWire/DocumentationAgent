# Documentation for `MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square`

### MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square() -> None

**Description:**
The `matrix_must_be_square` method is responsible for validating that a given matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. This validation is crucial in mathematical computations where square matrices are required, such as in certain linear algebra operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects a matrix input, which is typically represented as a list of lists (2D array). Each inner list represents a row of the matrix.
- The matrix must be non-empty and should contain rows of equal length.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks the number of rows in the matrix using the `len` function.
- It then iterates through each row of the matrix to ensure that the length of each row matches the total number of rows. If any row does not meet this criterion, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the matrix is not square.
- This method utilizes the `field_validator` function to enforce the validation rules, ensuring that the matrix adheres to the square matrix requirement before any further processing occurs. If the validation fails, the method will raise an appropriate exception, thereby preventing potential errors in subsequent operations that depend on the matrix being square.
