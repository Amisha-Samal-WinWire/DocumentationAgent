### RegressionInput.dependent_var_not_in_independent() -> None

**Description:**  
This method checks whether the dependent variable specified in a regression analysis is included within the set of independent variables. It serves as a validation step to ensure that the regression model is correctly specified, preventing logical errors in the analysis.

**Parameters:**  
None

**Expected Input:**  
- The method operates on the attributes of the `RegressionInput` class, which should already contain the definitions of the dependent and independent variables. It assumes that these attributes are properly initialized before the method is called.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method retrieves the names of the dependent variable and the independent variables from the class attributes.
- It then performs a check to determine if the dependent variable is present in the list of independent variables.
- If the dependent variable is found within the independent variables, the method may raise an error or return a warning, indicating that the model specification is incorrect.
- This validation step is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the regression analysis and preventing misleading results.
- The method does not rely on any external dependencies or modules, making it a self-contained validation function within the `RegressionInput` class.
