### RegressionInput.dependent_var_not_in_independent() -> None

**Description:**
This method is designed to validate that the dependent variable specified for a regression analysis is not included among the independent variables. It ensures that the model is correctly specified, as including the dependent variable in the set of independent variables would lead to incorrect model fitting and interpretation.

### RegressionInput.dependent_var_not_in_independent() -> None

**Description:**
The `dependent_var_not_in_independent` method is designed to validate that the dependent variable specified for a regression analysis is not included in the set of independent variables. This is a crucial step in ensuring the integrity of regression models, as including the dependent variable among the independent variables can lead to misleading results.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The method operates on the attributes of the `RegressionInput` class, which should contain a list of independent variables and a dependent variable. The dependent variable must be a single entity that is checked against the list of independent variables.
=======
- The method operates on the attributes of the `RegressionInput` class, which should include:
  - `dependent_var`: A string representing the name of the dependent variable.
  - `independent_vars`: A list of strings representing the names of the independent variables.
- It is expected that `dependent_var` and `independent_vars` are properly initialized before calling this method.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to perform its validation checks.
- It checks if the dependent variable is present in the list of independent variables.
- If the dependent variable is found within the independent variables, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the dependent variable cannot be included in the independent variable list.
- This validation step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the regression model and preventing logical errors during analysis.

=======
- The method first checks if the `dependent_var` is present in the `independent_vars` list.
- If the dependent variable is found within the independent variables, the method raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the dependent variable cannot be included in the independent variables.
- This validation helps maintain the integrity of the regression model by ensuring that the dependent variable is distinct from the independent variables, thereby preventing potential issues in the analysis. 
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` function to perform the validation check, ensuring that the input adheres to the expected criteria for regression analysis.
