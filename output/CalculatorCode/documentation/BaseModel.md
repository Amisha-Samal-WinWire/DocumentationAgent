# Documentation for `BaseModel`

### BaseModel

**Description:**
`BaseModel` serves as a foundational class designed to encapsulate common behaviors and properties that can be shared across various derived models within the application. It provides a structure for model instances, ensuring consistency and reusability of code.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `BaseModel` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. It is designed to be subclassed, where derived classes may introduce their own parameters.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `BaseModel` class is intended to be a base class, meaning it is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, it provides a template for other classes to inherit from.
- It may include common methods and properties that are relevant to all models, such as methods for data validation, serialization, or other utility functions that enhance the functionality of derived models.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, which suggests that it is self-contained and can be utilized independently in various contexts without requiring additional modules or libraries.
- The logic within `BaseModel` is likely focused on establishing a consistent interface and behavior for its subclasses, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy in the codebase.
