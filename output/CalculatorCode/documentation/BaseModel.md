# Documentation for `BaseModel`

### BaseModel

**Description:**
`BaseModel` serves as a foundational class designed to provide common functionality and attributes for derived models within the application. It encapsulates shared behaviors and properties that can be inherited by other classes, promoting code reuse and consistency across the codebase.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- There are no specific input parameters required for instantiation, as `BaseModel` does not define any constructor parameters. It is intended to be subclassed, and any required attributes or parameters should be defined in the derived classes.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- `BaseModel` is designed to be a base class, meaning it does not implement any specific logic or functionality on its own. Instead, it provides a structure for other classes to extend.
- Derived classes that inherit from `BaseModel` can implement their own methods and properties, leveraging the common functionality provided by `BaseModel`.
- The class may include placeholder methods or attributes that can be overridden or utilized by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface across different models.
- Since there are no internal dependencies or specific methods defined within `BaseModel`, its primary role is to act as a template for other models, facilitating the implementation of shared behaviors and attributes in a cohesive manner.
