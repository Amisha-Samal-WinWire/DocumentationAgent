# Documentation for `BaseModel`

### BaseModel

**Description:**
`BaseModel` serves as a foundational class designed to provide common functionality and attributes for derived models within the application. It encapsulates shared behaviors and properties that can be leveraged by subclasses, promoting code reuse and consistency across the codebase.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
None (as `BaseModel` does not require any input parameters upon instantiation).

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return any values upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `BaseModel` is intended to be subclassed, meaning it is not typically used directly but rather as a base for other models.
- The class may include methods and properties that are common to all models, such as validation methods, serialization/deserialization capabilities, or other utility functions.
- Subclasses that inherit from `BaseModel` can override or extend its functionality, allowing for specialized behavior while maintaining a consistent interface.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, indicating that it is self-contained and can be utilized in various contexts without requiring additional modules or libraries. 

This structure allows for a clean and organized approach to model management within the application, ensuring that shared logic is centralized in the `BaseModel` class.
