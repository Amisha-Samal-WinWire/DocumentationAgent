# Documentation for `join`

### join

**Description:**
The `join` function is designed to concatenate a sequence of strings into a single string, with a specified separator placed between each element. This function is commonly used for creating formatted output or for constructing paths and URLs by joining multiple string components.

**Parameters:**
- `separator` (`str`): The string that will be placed between each element of the sequence. This can be any string, including an empty string.
- `iterable` (`iterable`): A sequence (such as a list, tuple, or set) containing the strings to be joined. All elements in this iterable must be of type `str`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `separator` should be a valid string. It can be empty, which means no characters will be inserted between the joined elements.
- The `iterable` must contain only strings. If any element in the iterable is not a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.

**Returns:**
`str`: A single string that consists of the elements of the iterable concatenated together, separated by the specified `separator`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input types to ensure that the `iterable` contains only strings.
- It then iterates through the elements of the `iterable`, appending each element to a result string, inserting the `separator` between elements.
- If the `iterable` is empty, the function returns an empty string.
- The function efficiently handles the concatenation process, ensuring optimal performance even with larger datasets. It does not rely on any external modules or complex algorithms, instead utilizing basic string operations to achieve its functionality.
