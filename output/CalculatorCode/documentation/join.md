# Documentation for `join`

### join

**Description:**
The `join` function is designed to concatenate a sequence of strings into a single string, with a specified separator placed between each element. This function is commonly used for creating formatted output or for constructing paths and URLs from individual components.

**Parameters:**
- `separator` (`str`): A string that will be inserted between each of the elements being joined. This can be any string, including an empty string.
- `iterable` (`iterable`): A sequence (such as a list, tuple, or set) containing the strings to be joined. All elements in this iterable must be of type `str`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `separator` should be a string, which can include spaces, punctuation, or other characters. It can also be an empty string if no separator is desired.
- The `iterable` must contain only string elements. If any element is not a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.

**Returns:**
`str`: A single string that results from concatenating the elements of the iterable, separated by the specified separator.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input types of the `separator` and `iterable`. It ensures that the `separator` is a string and that all elements of the `iterable` are also strings.
- If the `iterable` is empty, the function returns an empty string.
- The function then iterates through the elements of the `iterable`, appending each element to the result string, preceded by the `separator`.
- Finally, it returns the constructed string. This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided parameters.
