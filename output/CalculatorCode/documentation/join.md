# Documentation for `join`

### join

**Description:**
The `join` function is designed to concatenate a sequence of strings into a single string, with a specified separator placed between each element. This function is commonly used for creating formatted output or for constructing paths and URLs from individual components.

**Parameters:**
- `iterable` (`iterable` of `str`): A sequence (such as a list or tuple) containing the strings to be joined.

**Expected Input:**
- The `iterable` parameter should consist solely of string elements. If any element in the iterable is not a string, a `TypeError` will be raised. The iterable can be empty, in which case the function will return an empty string.

**Returns:**
`str`: A single string that results from concatenating all the strings in the `iterable`, separated by the specified separator. If the iterable is empty, it returns an empty string.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function iterates over each element in the provided `iterable`.
- It checks the type of each element to ensure they are all strings; if any element is not a string, it raises a `TypeError`.
- It then concatenates the strings, inserting the specified separator between each pair of adjacent strings.
- The final result is a single string that represents the combined output of all elements in the iterable, formatted according to the specified separator.
