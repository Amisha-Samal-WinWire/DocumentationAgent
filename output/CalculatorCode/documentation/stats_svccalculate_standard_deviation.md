# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_standard_deviation`

### calculate_standard_deviation() -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a dataset, which is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The standard deviation quantifies how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean (average) value.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically in the form of a list or array of numerical values. The dataset should contain at least one numeric value to compute the standard deviation. If the dataset is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function may raise an error or return an undefined result.

**Returns:**
`float`: The calculated standard deviation of the dataset. This value represents the average distance of each data point from the mean, providing insight into the variability of the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by calculating the mean of the dataset.
- It then computes the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- The average of these squared differences is calculated, which is known as the variance.
- Finally, the standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and performs all calculations using basic arithmetic operations.
