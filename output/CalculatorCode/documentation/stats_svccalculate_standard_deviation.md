# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_standard_deviation`

### calculate_standard_deviation() -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a dataset, which is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically in the form of a list or array of numerical values. The dataset should contain at least one numeric value to compute the standard deviation. If the dataset is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function may raise an error or return an undefined result.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input dataset, representing the dispersion of the values around the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first calculates the mean (average) of the dataset.
- It then computes the variance by determining the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- Finally, the standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and performs all calculations using basic arithmetic operations.
