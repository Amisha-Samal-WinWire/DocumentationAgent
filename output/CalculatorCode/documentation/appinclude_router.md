# Documentation for `app.include_router`

### app.include_router(router: Router, prefix: Optional[str] = None, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, dependencies: Optional[List[Depends]] = None, responses: Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]] = None, default_response_class: Optional[Type[Response]] = None, include_in_schema: bool = True) -> None

**Description:**
The `include_router` function is a method of the FastAPI application instance that allows the integration of a router into the main application. This enables the organization of routes into modular components, facilitating better structure and maintainability of the application. By using routers, developers can group related endpoints and apply common configurations such as prefixes and tags.

**Parameters:**
- `router` (`Router`): An instance of the Router class that contains the routes to be included in the application.
- `prefix` (`Optional[str]`): An optional string that specifies a prefix to be added to all routes defined in the router. This is useful for grouping related routes under a common path.
- `tags` (`Optional[List[str]]`): An optional list of tags that can be associated with all routes in the router for documentation purposes.
- `dependencies` (`Optional[List[Depends]]`): An optional list of dependencies that should be applied to all routes in the router, allowing for shared logic such as authentication or data validation.
- `responses` (`Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]]`): An optional dictionary that defines custom responses for specific status codes across all routes in the router.
- `default_response_class` (`Optional[Type[Response]]`): An optional parameter that specifies the default response class to be used for all routes in the router.
- `include_in_schema` (`bool`): A boolean flag indicating whether the routes in the router should be included in the OpenAPI schema. Defaults to `True`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `router` parameter must be a valid Router instance.
- The `prefix` parameter should be a string that follows the routing conventions (e.g., starting with a `/`).
- The `tags` parameter should be a list of strings, each representing a tag for documentation.
- The `dependencies` parameter should be a list of dependency functions or classes that can be called for each route.
- The `responses` parameter should be a dictionary mapping status codes to response descriptions.
- The `default_response_class` should be a class that inherits from the Response class.
- The `include_in_schema` parameter should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return any value. It modifies the application instance by adding the routes defined in the provided router.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the provided `router` to ensure it is an instance of the Router class.
- If a `prefix` is provided, it prepends this prefix to all routes defined in the router, allowing for organized grouping.
- The function then associates any provided `tags` with the routes, enhancing the documentation generated for the API.
- If `dependencies` are specified, they are applied to all routes, ensuring that common logic is executed for each request.
- The `responses` dictionary is processed to set custom responses for the specified status codes, enhancing the API's response handling.
- The `default_response_class` is set for all routes, allowing for consistent response types.
- Finally, the function updates the OpenAPI schema based on the `include_in_schema` flag, determining whether the routes should be part of the generated API documentation. 

This modular approach provided by `include_router` enhances the scalability and maintainability of FastAPI applications by allowing developers to organize their routes logically.
