# Documentation for `app.include_router`

### app.include_router(router: Router, prefix: Optional[str] = None, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, dependencies: Optional[List[Depends]] = None, responses: Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]] = None, default_response_class: Optional[Type[Response]] = None, include_in_schema: bool = True) -> None

**Description:**
The `include_router` function is a method of the FastAPI application instance that allows the inclusion of an external router into the main application. This facilitates modularity and organization of routes, enabling developers to group related endpoints together and manage them more effectively.

**Parameters:**
- `router` (`Router`): An instance of the FastAPI `Router` class that contains the routes to be included in the application.
- `prefix` (`Optional[str]`): A string that will be prefixed to all routes defined in the included router. This allows for namespacing of routes.
- `tags` (`Optional[List[str]]`): A list of tags to associate with all routes in the included router, useful for documentation purposes.
- `dependencies` (`Optional[List[Depends]]`): A list of dependencies that should be applied to all routes in the included router.
- `responses` (`Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]]`): A dictionary of default responses that can be used for all routes in the included router.
- `default_response_class` (`Optional[Type[Response]]`): A default response class to be used for all routes in the included router.
- `include_in_schema` (`bool`): A flag indicating whether the routes in the included router should be included in the OpenAPI schema. Defaults to `True`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `router` parameter must be an instance of the FastAPI `Router` class.
- The `prefix` should be a string, or `None` if no prefix is desired.
- The `tags` parameter should be a list of strings, or `None` if no tags are to be applied.
- The `dependencies` parameter should be a list of dependencies, or `None` if no dependencies are required.
- The `responses` parameter should be a dictionary, or `None` if no default responses are specified.
- The `default_response_class` should be a class type derived from `Response`, or `None` if the default is to be used.
- The `include_in_schema` parameter should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return any value; it modifies the application instance by adding the routes from the provided router.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the provided `router` to ensure it is an instance of the `Router` class.
- If a `prefix` is provided, it prepends this prefix to all routes defined in the included router, effectively namespacing them.
- The function then applies any specified `tags` to the routes, enhancing the documentation generated by FastAPI.
- If `dependencies` are provided, they are added to all routes, allowing for shared logic such as authentication or validation.
- The `responses` dictionary is processed to set default responses for all routes, ensuring consistent error handling or response formatting.
- The `default_response_class` is set for the routes if specified, allowing for a consistent response type across the included routes.
- Finally, the function checks the `include_in_schema` flag to determine whether to include the routes in the OpenAPI schema, which is crucial for API documentation and client generation.
