# Documentation for `app.include_router`

### app.include_router(router: Router, prefix: Optional[str] = None, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, dependencies: Optional[List[Depends]] = None, responses: Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]] = None, default_response_class: Optional[Type[Response]] = None, include_in_schema: bool = True) -> None

**Description:**
The `include_router` function is used to include a router instance into the main application. This allows for modular organization of routes, enabling developers to group related endpoints together and manage them more effectively. By using routers, the application can maintain a cleaner structure and improve code maintainability.

**Parameters:**
- `router` (`Router`): An instance of the Router class that contains the routes to be included in the application.
- `prefix` (`Optional[str]`): A string that will be prefixed to all routes defined in the router. This is useful for namespacing routes.
- `tags` (`Optional[List[str]]`): A list of tags that can be used to categorize the routes for documentation purposes.
- `dependencies` (`Optional[List[Depends]]`): A list of dependencies that should be applied to all routes in the router. This allows for shared logic, such as authentication or data validation.
- `responses` (`Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]]`): A dictionary that defines custom responses for specific status codes, allowing for more detailed API documentation.
- `default_response_class` (`Optional[Type[Response]]`): A default response class that will be used for all routes in the router if not otherwise specified.
- `include_in_schema` (`bool`): A flag indicating whether the routes included in this router should be included in the OpenAPI schema. Defaults to `True`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `router` parameter must be a valid Router instance.
- The `prefix` should be a string if provided, and can be `None`.
- The `tags` should be a list of strings, or `None`.
- The `dependencies` should be a list of dependency instances, or `None`.
- The `responses` should be a dictionary mapping status codes to response descriptions, or `None`.
- The `default_response_class` should be a class type derived from `Response`, or `None`.
- The `include_in_schema` should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return any value. It modifies the application state by adding the routes from the provided router.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the provided `router` to ensure it is an instance of the Router class.
- If a `prefix` is provided, it modifies the routes in the router to include this prefix, effectively namespacing them.
- The function then processes any provided `tags`, associating them with the routes for better organization in the API documentation.
- If `dependencies` are specified, they are applied to all routes in the router, allowing for shared logic across multiple endpoints.
- The `responses` dictionary is utilized to enhance the API documentation by defining custom responses for specific HTTP status codes.
- The `default_response_class` is set for the routes, ensuring consistent response types unless overridden.
- Finally, the function updates the OpenAPI schema based on the `include_in_schema` flag, determining whether the routes should be included in the generated API documentation.
