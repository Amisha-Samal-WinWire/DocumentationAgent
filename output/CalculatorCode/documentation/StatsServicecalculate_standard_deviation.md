### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list[float], ddof: int = 0) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values, providing a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset. The standard deviation is computed using the NumPy library, which efficiently handles the calculations and provides accurate results.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list[float]`): A list containing numerical data for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.
- `ddof` (`int`, optional): "Delta Degrees of Freedom." This parameter adjusts the divisor used in the standard deviation calculation. The default value is 0, which calculates the population standard deviation. If set to 1, it calculates the sample standard deviation.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a list of floats or integers representing the dataset. The list must contain at least one numerical value.
- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer. Typically, it is set to 0 for population standard deviation or 1 for sample standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input list, representing the dispersion of the dataset. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability among the numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array to leverage NumPy's efficient computation capabilities.
- It then calls the `np.std` function, passing the array of numbers along with the specified `ddof` value to compute the standard deviation.
- The `np.std` function calculates the mean of the array elements, computes the variance by averaging the squared differences from the mean, and finally takes the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation.
- The function returns the calculated standard deviation as a float, which quantifies the extent of variation in the dataset.
