### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, indicating how much the individual numbers in the dataset deviate from the mean.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numerical values. The list must not be empty, as standard deviation cannot be computed for an empty dataset. It is also recommended that the list contains at least two numbers to provide a meaningful measure of variability.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the provided list of numbers, representing the average distance of each number from the mean of the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `np.std` method from the NumPy library to compute the standard deviation. 
- It first checks the input to ensure it is a valid list of numbers.
- The `np.std` function calculates the standard deviation by determining the mean of the numbers, then computing the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
- The result is returned as a floating-point number, which quantifies the spread of the dataset.

### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list[float], ddof: int = 0) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. The standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. This method utilizes NumPy's `np.std` function to perform the calculation, allowing for adjustments based on the degrees of freedom.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list[float]`): A list containing numerical data (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.
- `ddof` (`int`, optional): "Delta Degrees of Freedom." This parameter adjusts the divisor used in the standard deviation calculation. The default value is `0`, which computes the population standard deviation. A value of `1` computes the sample standard deviation.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a list of numerical values (either integers or floats). The list must not be empty, as standard deviation cannot be computed from an empty dataset.
- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer. If set to a value greater than the number of elements in `numbers`, it will raise an error.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input list of numbers. This value represents the extent to which the numbers in the list deviate from the mean of the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first validates the input list to ensure it contains numerical data and is not empty.
- It then calls the `np.std` function, passing the list of numbers along with the specified `ddof` parameter. This function computes the standard deviation based on the provided data.
- The result is a single float value representing the standard deviation, which indicates how spread out the numbers are in relation to their mean. The method does not modify the input list and returns the computed standard deviation directly.
