# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_standard_deviation`

### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list[float]) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values, providing a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset. The standard deviation is computed using NumPy's `np.std` function, which allows for both population and sample standard deviation calculations based on the specified parameters.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list[float]`): A list containing numerical values (either integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a list of numerical values. The list can contain any combination of integers and floats. It must not be empty, as the standard deviation cannot be computed for an empty dataset.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input list. This value represents the extent to which the numbers in the list deviate from their mean. If the input list is empty, the behavior is undefined, and an error may be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first ensures that the input `numbers` can be processed as an array-like structure, which is necessary for the subsequent calculation.
- It then calls the NumPy function `np.std` to compute the standard deviation. This function takes into account the degrees of freedom through the `ddof` parameter, allowing the user to specify whether to calculate the population or sample standard deviation.
- The output is a single float value representing the computed standard deviation, which indicates the level of dispersion in the input dataset.
