### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list[float]) -> float

**Description:**  
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers, which is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**  
- `numbers` should be a non-empty list containing numerical values (floats or integers). The list must contain at least two elements to compute a meaningful standard deviation, as a single value does not provide any variability.

**Returns:**  
`float`: The calculated standard deviation of the input list of numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The function first computes the mean (average) of the provided list of numbers.
- It then calculates the variance by determining the average of the squared differences between each number and the mean.
- Finally, the standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- This method does not rely on any external libraries or modules, and it performs calculations using basic arithmetic operations.
