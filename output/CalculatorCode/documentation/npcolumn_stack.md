# Documentation for `np.column_stack`

### np.column_stack(tup: tuple) -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `np.column_stack` function is used to stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array. This function is particularly useful for combining multiple arrays into a single array where each input array becomes a column in the resulting 2-D array. It effectively transforms the input arrays into a matrix format, facilitating operations that require 2-D data structures.

**Parameters:**
- `tup` (`tuple`): A tuple of 1-D arrays (or objects that can be converted to 1-D arrays) that are to be stacked as columns. Each array must have the same length.

**Expected Input:**
- The input should consist of one or more 1-D arrays. These can be lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays.
- All input arrays must have the same number of elements; otherwise, a `ValueError` will be raised.
- The function can accept a variable number of arrays, allowing for flexibility in the number of columns created.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A 2-D NumPy array where each input array is represented as a column. The shape of the resulting array will be `(N, K)`, where `N` is the length of the input arrays and `K` is the number of input arrays.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input to ensure that all arrays in the tuple have the same length.
- It then utilizes NumPy's internal mechanisms to create a new 2-D array by arranging the input arrays as columns.
- The resulting array is constructed in a way that preserves the order of the input arrays, ensuring that the first array in the tuple becomes the first column of the output, the second array becomes the second column, and so forth.
- This function is efficient and leverages NumPy's optimized array handling capabilities, making it suitable for large datasets. It does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided input arrays.
