# Documentation for `np.column_stack`

### np.column_stack(tup: tuple) -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `np.column_stack` function is used to stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array. This function is particularly useful for combining multiple arrays into a single array where each input array becomes a column in the resulting array.

**Parameters:**
- `tup` (`tuple`): A tuple of 1-D arrays (or sequences) that are to be stacked as columns. Each array must have the same length.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `tup` should consist of one or more 1-D arrays (e.g., lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays). All arrays must have the same number of elements; otherwise, a `ValueError` will be raised. The arrays can be of different data types, but the resulting array will have a common data type that can accommodate all input types.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A 2-D NumPy array where each input array from `tup` is represented as a column. The shape of the resulting array will be `(N, K)`, where `N` is the length of the input arrays and `K` is the number of input arrays.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks the input tuple to ensure that all arrays have the same length. If they do not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- It then constructs a new 2-D array by placing each 1-D array from the input tuple as a separate column in the resulting array.
- The function utilizes NumPy's internal mechanisms for array manipulation to efficiently create the output array.
- The resulting array is returned as a new NumPy ndarray, which can be further manipulated or analyzed using other NumPy functions.
