# Documentation for `np.column_stack`

### np.column_stack(tup: tuple) -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `np.column_stack` function is used to stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array. This function is particularly useful for combining multiple arrays into a single array where each input array becomes a column in the resulting 2-D array.

**Parameters:**
- `tup` (`tuple`): A tuple of 1-D arrays (or objects that can be converted to 1-D arrays) that you want to stack as columns. The arrays must have the same length.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `tup` should consist of one or more 1-D arrays. Each array must have the same number of elements; otherwise, a `ValueError` will be raised. The arrays can be of any numeric type (e.g., integers, floats) or even strings, as long as they are compatible for stacking.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A 2-D NumPy array where each input array from `tup` is stacked as a column. The shape of the resulting array will be `(N, K)`, where `N` is the length of the input arrays and `K` is the number of input arrays.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first verifies that all input arrays in the tuple have the same length. If they do not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- It then converts each input array into a column vector and combines them into a single 2-D array using NumPy's internal stacking mechanisms.
- The resulting array is constructed in such a way that the first input array becomes the first column, the second input array becomes the second column, and so on.
- This function is efficient and leverages NumPy's capabilities to handle array operations, ensuring that the output is a contiguous block of memory for optimal performance.
