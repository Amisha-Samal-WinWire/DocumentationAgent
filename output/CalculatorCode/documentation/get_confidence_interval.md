# Documentation for `get_confidence_interval`

### get_confidence_interval() -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
The `get_confidence_interval` function is designed to handle HTTP POST requests for calculating the confidence interval of a given dataset. It serves as an endpoint in the API that processes incoming data, invokes the necessary statistical calculations, and returns the computed confidence interval to the client.

**Parameters:**
- `Depends`: This function does not take any explicit parameters. Instead, it utilizes dependency injection to resolve necessary components or services required for its operation.

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset to be provided in the body of the POST request, typically in JSON format. The dataset should consist of numerical values that represent a sample from a larger population.
- The request must conform to the expected structure defined by the API, including appropriate headers and content type.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: The function returns a tuple containing two float values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the calculated confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon receiving a POST request, the function first extracts the dataset from the request body.
- It then calls the `stats_svc.calculate_confidence_interval` function, passing the extracted dataset as an argument. This function performs the statistical calculations necessary to determine the confidence interval based on the provided data.
- If the calculation is successful, the function prepares the response containing the confidence interval values.
- In case of any errors during the process, such as invalid input data or calculation failures, the function raises an `APIException` to handle the error gracefully and return a meaningful error message to the client.
- The function leverages the routing capabilities of the web framework to register itself as a handler for the specified endpoint, enabling it to respond to incoming requests appropriately.
