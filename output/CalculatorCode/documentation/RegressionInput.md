# Documentation for `RegressionInput`

### RegressionInput

**Description:**
`RegressionInput` is a model class designed for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It ensures that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby maintaining the integrity of the regression model. This class extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its foundational properties and methods while adding specific validation and management for regression inputs.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `RegressionInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to be instantiated with input data that includes distinct variables for regression analysis. The specifics of these variables are not detailed in the provided context, but they should adhere to the requirements of OLS regression, such as being numeric and free from multicollinearity.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; it creates an object that encapsulates the regression input data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `RegressionInput` leverages the functionality of `BaseModel` to ensure that the input variables are distinct. This is crucial for OLS regression, where multicollinearity can lead to unreliable estimates.
- The class may include methods for validating the distinctness of the input variables, potentially utilizing the `field_validator` function to enforce any necessary validation rules.
- By extending `BaseModel`, `RegressionInput` inherits any shared methods or properties, allowing it to maintain a consistent interface with other models in the application while focusing specifically on the requirements of regression analysis.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, making it a self-contained component that can be utilized in various contexts within the broader codebase.
