# Documentation for `RegressionInput`

### RegressionInput

**Description:**
`RegressionInput` is a model class designed for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It ensures that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing multicollinearity and ensuring the validity of the regression results.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- Instances of `RegressionInput` are expected to be initialized with distinct variables that will be used in the OLS regression. The specifics of these variables are not detailed in the provided context, but they should adhere to the requirements of being unique to avoid issues during regression analysis.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any value upon instantiation, as it is primarily a data structure for managing regression input.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `RegressionInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for model instances, ensuring consistency and reusability of code.
- The class is designed to validate that the input variables are distinct. This likely involves internal checks that compare the provided variables and raise exceptions (such as `ValueError`) if duplicates are detected.
- By ensuring distinct variables, `RegressionInput` helps maintain the integrity of the regression analysis, allowing for accurate coefficient estimation and hypothesis testing.
- The class may also include methods for data manipulation or validation, leveraging the functionality provided by `BaseModel` and potentially interacting with other components like `Field` for managing variable attributes. 

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `RegressionInput` class, outlining its intended use and functionality within the context of OLS regression analysis.
