# Documentation for `RegressionInput`

### RegressionInput

**Description:**
`RegressionInput` is a model class designed for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It ensures that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing multicollinearity issues that can skew the results of the regression analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `fields` (`List[Field]`): A list of `Field` objects representing the distinct variables that will be used in the regression model. Each `Field` encapsulates the properties and behaviors associated with a specific variable, including its name, type, and validation rules.

**Expected Input:**
- The `fields` attribute should contain a list of `Field` instances, each representing a variable in the regression model. Each `Field` must have a unique name to ensure that there are no duplicate variables in the model.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation but initializes an object representing the regression input model.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `RegressionInput` inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for the model.
- The class validates the uniqueness of the `Field` instances provided in the `fields` list. This validation is crucial to ensure that each variable is distinct and contributes uniquely to the regression analysis.
- The class may implement additional methods to facilitate the processing of the regression input, such as methods for adding or removing fields, validating the input data, and preparing the data for regression analysis.
- By leveraging the `Field` class, `RegressionInput` can manage the properties and validation of each variable effectively, ensuring that the input data adheres to the specified criteria before being used in regression calculations.
