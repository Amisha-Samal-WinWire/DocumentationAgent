### RegressionInput

**Description:**  
The `RegressionInput` class serves as a model for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It is designed to ensure that the dependent variable is distinct from the independent variables, thereby maintaining the integrity of the regression model specification.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `dependent_variable` (`str`): The name of the dependent variable in the regression analysis.
- `independent_variables` (`list[str]`): A list of names representing the independent variables used in the regression analysis.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `dependent_variable` should be a string representing the name of the variable that the model aims to predict.
- The `independent_variables` should be a list of strings, each representing a variable that is used to predict the dependent variable. It is crucial that the dependent variable is not included in this list to avoid logical errors in the regression model.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The class initializes with the specified dependent and independent variables.
- It includes a method, `dependent_var_not_in_independent`, which performs a validation check to ensure that the dependent variable is not included in the list of independent variables.
- This method retrieves the names of the dependent and independent variables from the class attributes and checks for the presence of the dependent variable within the independent variables.
- If the dependent variable is found in the independent variables, the method raises an error or returns a warning, indicating an incorrect model specification.
- This validation is essential for preventing misleading results in regression analysis and ensuring that the model is correctly specified.
- The class operates independently without reliance on external modules, making it a self-contained component for regression input validation.
