### RegressionInput

**Description:**
The `RegressionInput` class serves as a model for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It is designed to ensure that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing issues that may arise from multicollinearity. This class encapsulates the necessary attributes and validation logic required for preparing data for OLS regression.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `dependent_variable` (`Field`): Represents the dependent variable in the regression model. It must be distinct from the independent variables.
  - `independent_variables` (`List[Field]`): A list of independent variables used in the regression. Each variable must be distinct from one another and from the dependent variable.
  
**Expected Input:**
- The `dependent_variable` must be a valid field that is distinct from all entries in `independent_variables`.
- The `independent_variables` must be a list of valid fields, ensuring that no two variables in this list are the same, and that none of them match the `dependent_variable`.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that can be used for further regression analysis.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `RegressionInput` class validates the provided `dependent_variable` and `independent_variables` to ensure that they are distinct. This is crucial for the integrity of the regression analysis.
- The class leverages external libraries such as `Field` for defining the structure of the variables and `field_validator` for implementing the validation logic.
- If the validation fails (e.g., if any variables are not distinct), a `ValueError` is raised, indicating the nature of the input error.
- The class does not perform any regression calculations itself but serves as a preparatory step for ensuring that the data is suitable for OLS regression analysis.

### RegressionInput

**Description:**
`RegressionInput` is a model class designed for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It ensures that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing multicollinearity and ensuring the validity of the regression results.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- Instances of `RegressionInput` are expected to be initialized with distinct variables that will be used in the OLS regression. The specifics of these variables are not detailed in the provided context, but they should adhere to the requirements of being unique to avoid issues during regression analysis.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any value upon instantiation, as it is primarily a data structure for managing regression input.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `RegressionInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for model instances, ensuring consistency and reusability of code.
- The class is designed to validate that the input variables are distinct. This likely involves internal checks that compare the provided variables and raise exceptions (such as `ValueError`) if duplicates are detected.
- By ensuring distinct variables, `RegressionInput` helps maintain the integrity of the regression analysis, allowing for accurate coefficient estimation and hypothesis testing.
- The class may also include methods for data manipulation or validation, leveraging the functionality provided by `BaseModel` and potentially interacting with other components like `Field` for managing variable attributes. 

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `RegressionInput` class, outlining its intended use and functionality within the context of OLS regression analysis.
