# Documentation for `StaticFiles`

### StaticFiles

**Description:**
`StaticFiles` is a class designed to serve static files in a web application context. It provides a mechanism for efficiently handling requests for static content, such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files, ensuring that these resources are delivered to clients with optimal performance.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `directory` (`str`): The path to the directory containing the static files to be served.
- `check_interval` (`int`, optional): The interval in seconds for checking if the files have changed. Default is `0`, which means no checking.
- `html` (`bool`, optional): A flag indicating whether to serve HTML files. Default is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- `directory` should be a valid string path pointing to a directory that contains static files.
- `check_interval` should be a non-negative integer, where a value of `0` indicates that the files will not be checked for updates.
- `html` should be a boolean value indicating whether HTML files should be served.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but initializes an instance that can handle static file requests.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `StaticFiles` class sets up the directory from which static files will be served.
- It configures the file serving behavior based on the provided parameters, such as whether to check for file changes and whether to allow serving of HTML files.
- The class likely includes methods to handle incoming requests, determine the appropriate file to serve based on the request path, and manage caching or file validation based on the `check_interval`.
- The implementation may involve interacting with the file system to locate and read the specified static files, as well as handling HTTP response headers to ensure proper content delivery.
