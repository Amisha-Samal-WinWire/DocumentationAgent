# Documentation for `StaticFiles`

### StaticFiles

**Description:**
`StaticFiles` is a class designed to serve static files in a web application context. It facilitates the efficient retrieval and delivery of files such as images, stylesheets, and scripts from a specified directory, ensuring that these resources can be accessed by clients over HTTP. This class is particularly useful in web frameworks where static content needs to be served alongside dynamic content.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `directory` (`str`): The path to the directory containing the static files. This parameter is essential for locating the files to be served.
- `check_interval` (`int`, optional): An integer that specifies the interval (in seconds) for checking the modification time of the files. This allows for the detection of changes in the static files, ensuring that clients receive the most up-to-date versions.
- `html` (`bool`, optional): A boolean flag indicating whether to serve HTML files. If set to `True`, the class will handle HTML files appropriately, potentially altering the response headers or content type.

**Expected Input:**
- `directory` must be a valid string path pointing to a directory on the server where static files are stored.
- `check_interval` should be a non-negative integer, with a default value typically set to 0, meaning no periodic checks for file updates.
- `html` should be a boolean value, defaulting to `False`, indicating whether HTML files should be served.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but instead provides methods to handle HTTP requests for static files.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `StaticFiles` class initializes with the specified directory and optional parameters for file checking and HTML handling.
- The class includes methods to handle incoming HTTP requests, determining the appropriate file to serve based on the request path.
- It checks the existence of the requested file and verifies permissions before serving it.
- If `check_interval` is set, the class will monitor the modification times of the files at the specified interval, allowing it to serve updated content when changes are detected.
- The class may also adjust response headers based on the file type, particularly if HTML files are being served, ensuring that the correct content type is communicated to the client.
- Overall, `StaticFiles` interacts with the web server's request handling mechanisms to efficiently serve static content while providing options for dynamic updates and content type management.
