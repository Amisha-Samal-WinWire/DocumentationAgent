# Documentation for `UploadFile`

### UploadFile

**Description:**
The `UploadFile` class is designed to facilitate the uploading of files in a structured manner. It provides methods and attributes that allow users to manage file uploads efficiently, handling various aspects such as file validation, storage, and metadata management.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `file_path` (`str`): The path to the file that is to be uploaded. This should be a valid file path on the local filesystem.
- `file_type` (`str`): The MIME type of the file being uploaded (e.g., 'image/jpeg', 'application/pdf'). This helps in validating the file type before upload.
- `file_size` (`int`): The size of the file in bytes. This attribute is used to enforce size limits during the upload process.
- `destination` (`str`): The target location where the file will be stored after upload. This could be a local directory or a remote server endpoint.

**Expected Input:**
- The `file_path` should point to an existing file on the local filesystem.
- The `file_type` should correspond to the actual type of the file being uploaded.
- The `file_size` should be a positive integer representing the size of the file in bytes.
- The `destination` should be a valid path or URL where the file can be uploaded.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation or method execution. Instead, it performs actions related to file uploading.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `UploadFile` class validates the provided `file_path`, ensuring that the file exists and is accessible.
- It checks the `file_type` against a predefined list of acceptable MIME types to ensure that only valid files are uploaded.
- The `file_size` is compared against a maximum allowed size to prevent excessively large uploads.
- If all validations pass, the class prepares the file for upload, which may involve reading the file contents and preparing them for transfer.
- The upload process itself may involve calling external APIs or services, depending on the specified `destination`, and handling any errors that arise during this process.
- The class may also provide methods for tracking the upload progress and managing any necessary cleanup after the upload is complete.
