# Documentation for `os.remove`

### os.remove(path: str) -> None

**Description:**
The `os.remove` function is used to delete a file from the filesystem. It takes a file path as an argument and removes the specified file. If the file does not exist or if the user lacks the necessary permissions to delete the file, an error will be raised.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The path to the file that needs to be deleted. This can be an absolute or relative path.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a string representing the file path. The specified file must exist in the filesystem for the function to execute successfully. If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised. Additionally, the user must have the appropriate permissions to delete the file; otherwise, a `PermissionError` will occur.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value upon successful execution. If an error occurs, it raises an exception instead.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first verifies the existence of the file at the specified path. If the file is found, it proceeds to delete it from the filesystem.
- If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised, indicating that the operation cannot be completed because the file is not present.
- If the user does not have the necessary permissions to delete the file, a `PermissionError` is raised, preventing the deletion.
- The function does not perform any additional operations or checks beyond the file deletion process, relying on the underlying operating system's file handling capabilities to manage the deletion.
