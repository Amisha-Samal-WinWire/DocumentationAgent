# Documentation for `os.remove`

### os.remove(path: str) -> None

**Description:**
The `os.remove` function is used to delete a file from the filesystem. It takes a file path as an argument and removes the specified file. If the file does not exist or if the user does not have the necessary permissions to delete the file, an error will be raised.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The path to the file that needs to be deleted. This can be an absolute or relative path.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a string representing the file path. The specified path must point to an existing file; otherwise, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised. The user must also have the appropriate permissions to delete the file, or a `PermissionError` will occur.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return any value. It performs the action of deleting the specified file.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks if the specified path points to a valid file. If the file exists, it proceeds to remove it from the filesystem.
- If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised, indicating that the specified file could not be found.
- If the user lacks the necessary permissions to delete the file, a `PermissionError` is raised.
- The function does not interact with any external modules or dependencies; it directly interfaces with the operating system to perform the file deletion.
