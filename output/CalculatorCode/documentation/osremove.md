# Documentation for `os.remove`

### os.remove(path: str) -> None

**Description:**
The `os.remove` function is used to delete a file from the filesystem. It takes a file path as an argument and removes the specified file. If the file does not exist or if the user does not have the necessary permissions to delete the file, an error will be raised.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The path to the file that needs to be removed. This can be an absolute or relative path.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a string representing the file's location in the filesystem. It must point to a valid file that exists; otherwise, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised. The user must also have the appropriate permissions to delete the file.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return a value. If the operation is successful, the specified file is deleted from the filesystem.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks if the specified file exists at the given path. If it does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.
- If the file exists, the function attempts to remove it. If the user lacks the necessary permissions, a `PermissionError` will be raised.
- The function operates directly on the filesystem and does not return any value upon successful deletion. It is important to handle exceptions that may arise during the operation to ensure robust error handling in the calling code.
