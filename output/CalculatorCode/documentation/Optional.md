# Documentation for `Optional`

### Optional

**Description:**
The `Optional` class is designed to represent a value that may or may not be present. It provides a way to handle the absence of a value in a type-safe manner, allowing developers to avoid null references and the associated errors. This class is particularly useful in scenarios where a variable may not have a meaningful value, enabling clearer code and reducing the risk of runtime exceptions.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `Optional` class can be instantiated with any type of value or left empty to represent the absence of a value. If a value is provided, it should be of a specific type that the user intends to encapsulate. If no value is provided, it indicates that the optional value is absent.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Optional` class encapsulates a value, providing methods to check for its presence and to retrieve it safely.
- When an instance of `Optional` is created with a value, it stores that value internally. If created without a value, it signifies that the optional value is not present.
- The class typically includes methods such as `is_present()` to check if a value exists, and `get()` to retrieve the value if it is present, throwing an exception or returning a default value if it is not.
- This design pattern encourages developers to explicitly handle cases where a value may be absent, promoting safer and more maintainable code.
