# Documentation for `Optional`

### Optional

**Description:**
`Optional` is a utility that represents an optional value, which can either hold a value of a specified type or be empty (None). It is commonly used in programming to indicate that a variable may or may not contain a value, allowing for more flexible and safer code by avoiding null reference errors.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- `Optional` can be instantiated with a value of any type or left empty. If a value is provided, it should be of the specified type; otherwise, it can be set to None.

**Returns:**
`Optional`: An instance that either contains a value of the specified type or is empty.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Optional` class encapsulates the concept of an optional value. When instantiated, it can either be initialized with a specific value or remain empty.
- The class typically provides methods to check if a value is present, retrieve the value if it exists, and handle cases where the value is absent.
- This design pattern helps to avoid direct null checks in the code, promoting safer handling of potentially absent values.
- The `Optional` class does not have any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility that can be utilized across various parts of the codebase without reliance on other modules.
