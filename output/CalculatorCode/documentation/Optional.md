# Documentation for `Optional`

### Optional

**Description:**
The `Optional` class is a utility designed to represent a value that may or may not be present. It provides a way to handle cases where a variable could be `None`, allowing for safer and more expressive code when dealing with potentially absent values.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The `Optional` class is typically instantiated with a value that can be of any type or `None`. If a value is provided, it signifies the presence of a valid value; if `None` is provided, it indicates the absence of a value.

**Returns:**
- The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it encapsulates the provided value (or lack thereof) for further operations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Optional` class serves as a wrapper around a value, allowing the user to check for its presence or absence without directly dealing with `None` checks.
- When an instance of `Optional` is created, it stores the provided value internally.
- The class typically includes methods to check if a value is present, retrieve the value if it exists, and possibly provide a default value if it does not.
- This design pattern encourages developers to explicitly handle cases where a value might be absent, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors associated with `None` values.
