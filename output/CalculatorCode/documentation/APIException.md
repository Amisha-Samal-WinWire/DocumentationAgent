### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for the API. It facilitates the creation of a structured error handling mechanism that allows the API to return well-formed JSON error messages. This class serves as a foundation for defining various API-related exceptions, ensuring that all exceptions can be handled uniformly.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).
- `detail` (`str`): A string providing a detailed message about the exception, which can be used to convey specific error information to the client.

**Expected Input:**
- The `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically in the range of 100 to 599.
- The `detail` should be a descriptive string that explains the nature of the error encountered.

**Returns:**
None. The constructor initializes the exception instance but does not return a value.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIException` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, allowing it to function as a standard exception.
- Upon initialization, the constructor takes two parameters: `status_code` and `detail`. These parameters are assigned to instance attributes for later use.
- The constructor then calls the superclass's (`Exception`) constructor with the `detail` message, which sets up the exception message that will be displayed when the exception is raised.
- This class does not implement additional methods or properties beyond those inherited from `Exception`, but it provides a structured way to handle API errors consistently across the application.

### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within the API framework of the application. By extending the built-in `Exception` class, it allows for the creation of structured and meaningful error messages that can be returned in a JSON format. This facilitates a consistent error handling mechanism across the API, enabling developers to manage exceptions effectively in the main application logic.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `APIException` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is common practice to pass a descriptive message string that outlines the nature of the error when raising this exception.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIException` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, leveraging its functionality to signal errors in the application.
- By subclassing `Exception`, `APIException` can be raised in various parts of the API code when an error condition is encountered.
- The custom exception can be caught in a `try` block, allowing the application to handle the error gracefully and return a structured JSON response to the client.
- This class serves as a foundation for more specific exceptions that may be defined later, enabling a clear hierarchy of error types within the API.
