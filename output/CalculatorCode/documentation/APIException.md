### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within the API framework of the application. By extending the built-in `Exception` class, it allows for the creation of structured and meaningful error messages that can be returned in a JSON format. This facilitates the implementation of a custom exception handler in the main application logic, enabling consistent error reporting across the API.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `APIException` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is common practice to pass a descriptive message string when raising this exception to provide context about the error.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIException` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, which serves as the foundation for all exceptions in Python. This inheritance allows `APIException` to leverage the standard exception handling mechanisms provided by Python.
- When an instance of `APIException` is created, it can optionally accept a message that describes the error. This message can be accessed later when the exception is caught, allowing developers to understand the nature of the error that occurred.
- The primary purpose of `APIException` is to serve as a base class for other specific exceptions that may arise within the API, enabling a structured approach to error handling and ensuring that all API-related errors can be managed consistently.
- The class does not introduce any additional attributes or methods beyond what is inherited from the `Exception` class, focusing solely on providing a custom exception type for the API context.
