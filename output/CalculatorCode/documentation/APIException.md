### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within an API context. It serves as a foundation for creating more specific exception types that can be raised in response to various error conditions encountered during API operations. This class facilitates the implementation of a structured error handling mechanism, allowing the application to return consistent JSON-formatted error messages to clients.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not take any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is intended to be subclassed, where derived classes may define their own attributes or accept parameters relevant to specific error conditions.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIException` class inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class, utilizing the `super().__init__` method to initialize the base exception.
- By extending the base exception class, `APIException` allows developers to create custom exceptions that can be raised in various parts of the API code. This enables the application to handle errors in a uniform manner.
- The primary purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to manage exceptions, which can be caught and processed by a custom exception handler defined in the main application file (`main.py`). This handler can then format the error messages into structured JSON responses, improving the clarity and usability of error reporting for API clients.
