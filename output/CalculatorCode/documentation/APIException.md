### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within the API framework of the application. By extending the built-in `Exception` class, it allows for the creation of structured and meaningful error messages that can be returned in a JSON format. This facilitates a consistent error handling mechanism across the API, enabling developers to manage exceptions effectively in the main application logic.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `APIException` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is common practice to pass a descriptive message string that outlines the nature of the error when raising this exception.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIException` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, leveraging its functionality to signal errors in the application.
- By subclassing `Exception`, `APIException` can be raised in various parts of the API code when an error condition is encountered.
- The custom exception can be caught in a `try` block, allowing the application to handle the error gracefully and return a structured JSON response to the client.
- This class serves as a foundation for more specific exceptions that may be defined later, enabling a clear hierarchy of error types within the API.
