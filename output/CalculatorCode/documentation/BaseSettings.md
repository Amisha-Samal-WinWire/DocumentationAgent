# Documentation for `BaseSettings`

### BaseSettings

**Description:**
`BaseSettings` serves as a foundational class designed to manage configuration settings within an application. It provides a structured way to define, access, and validate settings, ensuring that the application can operate with the correct parameters. This class is typically extended by other classes that require specific configuration settings, allowing for a consistent interface and behavior across different settings implementations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `BaseSettings` class does not define any parameters or attributes directly within its implementation. Instead, it is intended to be subclassed, where specific settings can be defined.

**Expected Input:**
- As `BaseSettings` does not accept any direct input parameters, the expected input is determined by the subclasses that extend it. These subclasses should define their own settings, which may include various data types such as strings, integers, or booleans, depending on the application's requirements.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `BaseSettings` class does not return any values directly. Its purpose is to provide a structure for settings management rather than to produce output.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `BaseSettings` class is designed to encapsulate the logic necessary for managing application settings. While the specific implementation details are not provided, the class likely includes methods for loading settings from various sources (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) and validating them against predefined criteria.
- Subclasses that inherit from `BaseSettings` can define their own attributes, which represent specific settings required by the application. These subclasses can leverage the base functionality provided by `BaseSettings` to ensure that their settings are handled consistently.
- The class may also include mechanisms for type checking and default values, ensuring that all settings conform to expected formats and types, thus enhancing the robustness of the application configuration process.
