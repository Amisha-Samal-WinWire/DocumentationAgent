# Documentation for `BaseSettings`

### BaseSettings

**Description:**
`BaseSettings` is a foundational class designed to manage and encapsulate configuration settings for applications. It provides a structured way to define, access, and validate settings, ensuring that the application can retrieve configuration values consistently and reliably.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to be initialized with a set of configuration parameters, typically provided as a dictionary or through environment variables. The specific structure and types of these parameters depend on the application's requirements.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `BaseSettings` class is designed to serve as a base for other settings classes, allowing for inheritance and extension. It likely includes mechanisms for loading settings from various sources, such as environment variables or configuration files.
- The class may implement validation logic to ensure that the provided settings conform to expected types and constraints, raising errors when invalid configurations are detected.
- It may also provide default values for certain settings, ensuring that the application can operate even if some configurations are not explicitly provided.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, making it a standalone component that can be integrated into various parts of an application without requiring additional modules.
