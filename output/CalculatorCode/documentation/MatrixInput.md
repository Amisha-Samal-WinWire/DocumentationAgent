# Documentation for `MatrixInput`

### MatrixInput

**Description:**
`MatrixInput` is a model class designed to facilitate matrix operations within the application. It includes built-in validators to ensure that the input matrices conform to specified criteria, as well as a helper function to assist with matrix-related tasks. This class extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its properties and methods to promote code reuse and maintain consistency across different models.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `matrix` (`List[List[float]]`): A two-dimensional list representing the matrix data. Each inner list corresponds to a row in the matrix.
- `validators` (`List[Callable]`): A list of validation functions that are applied to the matrix data to ensure it meets certain criteria (e.g., dimensions, data types).
- `field_name` (`str`): The name of the field being validated, typically used in conjunction with the validators.

**Expected Input:**
- The `matrix` attribute should be a two-dimensional list (a list of lists) containing numerical values (floats or integers).
- The `validators` should be a list of callable functions that accept the matrix data and return a boolean indicating whether the data is valid.
- The `field_name` should be a string representing the name of the matrix field.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation but initializes an object representing a matrix input model.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `MatrixInput` initializes its attributes based on the provided parameters, leveraging the constructor of the `BaseModel`.
- The class applies the specified validators to the `matrix` attribute to ensure that the input data adheres to the defined rules. This may include checks for required dimensions, data types, and other constraints.
- If any validation fails, appropriate exceptions may be raised to indicate the nature of the validation error.
- The class may also include a helper function that performs common matrix operations, such as addition, multiplication, or transposition, utilizing the NumPy library for efficient computation.
- By extending `BaseModel`, `MatrixInput` inherits common functionality, allowing for consistent handling of model attributes and behaviors across different matrix-related classes.
