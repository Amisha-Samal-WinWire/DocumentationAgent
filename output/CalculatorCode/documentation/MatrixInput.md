### MatrixInput

**Description:**  
The `MatrixInput` class serves as a model for performing matrix operations. It includes validation methods to ensure that matrices meet necessary criteria, such as being square, and provides a utility function to convert the internal matrix representation into a NumPy array format for enhanced computational capabilities.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `matrix` (`list[list[float]]`): A two-dimensional list representing the matrix. Each inner list corresponds to a row in the matrix and must contain the same number of elements (columns).

**Expected Input:**  
- The `matrix` attribute should be a valid matrix-like structure, typically a list of lists, where each inner list has the same length. The matrix must be defined before invoking any operations that depend on its structure.

**Returns:**  
`None`: The class itself does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it provides methods that may return values based on the operations performed on the matrix.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The class includes a method `matrix_must_be_square`, which checks if the matrix is square by comparing the number of rows to the number of columns. If the matrix is not square, it raises an exception to prevent further operations that require a square matrix.
- Another method, `to_numpy_array`, converts the internal matrix representation to a NumPy array. This method accesses the matrix data and utilizes NumPy's capabilities to facilitate numerical computations and data analysis.
- The class is designed to ensure that any matrix operations performed are valid and that the data is in a format suitable for further mathematical processing.
