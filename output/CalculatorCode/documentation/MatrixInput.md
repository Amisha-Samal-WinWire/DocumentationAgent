### MatrixInput

**Description:**
`MatrixInput` is a model designed for handling matrix operations within the application. It incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure that the input matrices conform to specified criteria, and it provides a helper function to facilitate matrix-related tasks. This class is built upon the `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational features to enhance functionality.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `matrix` (`np.array`): This attribute holds the matrix data as a NumPy array. It is the primary data structure for matrix operations and is subject to validation.
  - Additional attributes may be defined within the class, but specific details are not provided.

**Expected Input:**
- The `matrix` attribute is expected to be a NumPy array. The input should adhere to the following constraints:
  - The matrix should be two-dimensional (i.e., it must have rows and columns).
  - The data type of the elements within the matrix should be numeric (e.g., integers or floats).
  - Validation checks may enforce specific dimensions or properties, depending on the implementation.

**Returns:**
- The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that can be used for further matrix operations and validations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `MatrixInput` class utilizes the `BaseModel` to inherit common functionalities and properties.
- The class likely employs the `Field` and `field_validator` from the external libraries to define and validate the `matrix` attribute. This ensures that any matrix assigned to the attribute meets the required specifications.
- The helper function within the class is designed to perform specific matrix operations, although the exact nature of these operations is not detailed in the provided information.
- The class interacts with NumPy (`np.array`) to facilitate efficient matrix manipulations, leveraging its capabilities for mathematical operations and data handling.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `MatrixInput` class, outlining its purpose, expected behavior, and the underlying logic that governs its functionality.

### MatrixInput

**Description:**
The `MatrixInput` class is designed to facilitate matrix operations within the application. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, incorporating validators to ensure that the matrix data adheres to specified constraints. Additionally, it includes a helper function to assist with matrix-related tasks, promoting efficient data handling and manipulation.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes**: None explicitly listed in the provided context, but it is expected that the class will define attributes related to matrix data and possibly validation rules.

**Expected Input:**
- The `MatrixInput` class is expected to handle matrix data, which may be provided in various formats (e.g., lists of lists, NumPy arrays). The input should conform to the validation rules defined within the class to ensure data integrity and correctness.

**Returns:**
- None: The class does not return a value upon instantiation but is intended to manage and validate matrix data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `MatrixInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational capabilities for model behavior and structure.
- Upon instantiation, the class likely initializes attributes related to the matrix data, which may include dimensions, data type, and other relevant properties.
- The class employs validators to check the integrity of the input matrix data. This may involve verifying that the data is in the correct format, ensuring that all rows have the same length, and checking for any constraints defined in the validation rules.
- The helper function within the class is designed to perform specific matrix operations, which may include tasks such as addition, multiplication, or transformation of the matrix data.
- The class interacts with the `field_validator` function to enforce validation rules, ensuring that any matrix input adheres to the specified criteria before being processed or stored.
- Additionally, it may utilize `np.array` to convert input data into a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations, enhancing performance and usability within the application. 

This comprehensive design allows the `MatrixInput` class to serve as a robust model for managing matrix data, ensuring that all operations are performed on valid and correctly formatted matrices.
