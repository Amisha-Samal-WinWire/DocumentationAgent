# Documentation for `MatrixInput`

### MatrixInput

**Description:**
`MatrixInput` is a model class designed to facilitate matrix operations within the application. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, incorporating validators to ensure the integrity of matrix data and providing a helper function to assist with matrix-related tasks.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `MatrixInput` class does not define any explicit parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle matrix data, which may be provided in various formats (e.g., lists of lists, tuples). The specific structure and constraints of the matrix data will be validated through the incorporated validators.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any values upon instantiation. It serves as a model for managing matrix data and operations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `MatrixInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational capabilities for model management.
- The class includes validators that ensure the matrix data adheres to specified criteria, such as dimensions and data types, enhancing data integrity.
- A helper function is provided to facilitate common matrix operations, although the specific functionality of this helper is not detailed in the provided context.
- The class operates independently, relying on its own logic and the methods inherited from `BaseModel` to manage matrix data effectively.
- The validators and helper function work together to ensure that any matrix operations performed using this class are based on valid and correctly formatted data, thereby preventing errors in subsequent calculations or manipulations.
