# Documentation for `MatrixInput`

### MatrixInput

**Description:**
The `MatrixInput` class is designed to facilitate matrix operations within the application. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, incorporating validators to ensure that the matrix data adheres to specified constraints. Additionally, it includes a helper function to assist with matrix-related tasks, promoting efficient data handling and manipulation.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes**: None explicitly listed in the provided context, but it is expected that the class will define attributes related to matrix data and possibly validation rules.

**Expected Input:**
- The `MatrixInput` class is expected to handle matrix data, which may be provided in various formats (e.g., lists of lists, NumPy arrays). The input should conform to the validation rules defined within the class to ensure data integrity and correctness.

**Returns:**
- None: The class does not return a value upon instantiation but is intended to manage and validate matrix data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `MatrixInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational capabilities for model behavior and structure.
- Upon instantiation, the class likely initializes attributes related to the matrix data, which may include dimensions, data type, and other relevant properties.
- The class employs validators to check the integrity of the input matrix data. This may involve verifying that the data is in the correct format, ensuring that all rows have the same length, and checking for any constraints defined in the validation rules.
- The helper function within the class is designed to perform specific matrix operations, which may include tasks such as addition, multiplication, or transformation of the matrix data.
- The class interacts with the `field_validator` function to enforce validation rules, ensuring that any matrix input adheres to the specified criteria before being processed or stored.
- Additionally, it may utilize `np.array` to convert input data into a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations, enhancing performance and usability within the application. 

This comprehensive design allows the `MatrixInput` class to serve as a robust model for managing matrix data, ensuring that all operations are performed on valid and correctly formatted matrices.
