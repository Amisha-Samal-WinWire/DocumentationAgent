### StatsService.calculate_descriptive_stats(numbers: list) -> dict

**Description:**
Calculates descriptive statistics for a given list of numerical values. This method computes key statistical measures, including the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, and returns them in a structured dictionary format. It is useful for summarizing and understanding the characteristics of a dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numeric values. The list can be of any length, but it must contain at least one numeric element to compute meaningful statistics. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return a specific value indicating that no statistics can be computed.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding statistical values:
- `mean`: The average of the numbers.
- `median`: The middle value when the numbers are sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring number in the list.
- `variance`: A measure of how much the numbers vary from the mean.
- `standard_deviation`: The square root of the variance, representing the dispersion of the numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input list to ensure it contains numeric values.
- It utilizes the following external library functions to compute the statistics:
  - `np.mean`: Calculates the average of the numbers.
  - `np.median`: Determines the median value of the sorted list.
  - `stats.mode`: Identifies the mode, or the most frequently occurring value.
  - `np.var`: Computes the variance of the numbers.
  - `np.std`: Calculates the standard deviation based on the variance.
- Each of these calculations is performed sequentially, and the results are collected into a dictionary.
- Finally, the function returns this dictionary, providing a comprehensive overview of the descriptive statistics for the input list.

=======
- `numbers` should be a non-empty list containing numerical data. The function expects at least one element in the list to compute the statistics. If the list is empty, it may raise an error or return default values.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics:
- `mean` (`float`): The average of the numbers.
- `median` (`float`): The middle value when the numbers are sorted.
- `mode` (`int`): The most frequently occurring value in the list.
- `variance` (`float`): A measure of the dispersion of the numbers around the mean.
- `standard_deviation` (`float`): The square root of the variance, indicating the amount of variation in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by validating the input list `numbers` to ensure it contains valid numerical data.
- It then utilizes the `np.mean` function to calculate the mean of the numbers.
- The median is computed using the `np.median` function, which sorts the data and finds the middle value.
- The mode is determined using the `stats.mode` function, which identifies the most frequently occurring number in the list.
- Variance is calculated using the `np.var` function, which measures how far each number in the list is from the mean.
- Finally, the standard deviation is computed using the `np.std` function, providing insight into the spread of the numbers.
- The results are compiled into a dictionary and returned, allowing for easy access to each statistical measure.
