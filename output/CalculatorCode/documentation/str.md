# Documentation for `str`

### str

**Description:**
The `str` function is a built-in Python function that converts an object into its string representation. It is commonly used to create a human-readable version of various data types, making it easier to display or log information.

**Parameters:**
- `object` (`Any`): The object to be converted into a string. This can be any Python data type, including numbers, lists, dictionaries, or custom objects.

**Expected Input:**
- The `object` parameter can be of any type. There are no specific constraints on the input, as the function is designed to handle a wide range of data types, including user-defined classes.

**Returns:**
`str`: The string representation of the input object. If the object has a custom string representation defined (via the `__str__` method), that representation will be returned; otherwise, a default string representation will be provided.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `str` function first checks if the provided object has a `__str__` method defined. If it does, this method is called to obtain the string representation.
- If the object does not have a `__str__` method, the function falls back to the default behavior, which typically returns a string that includes the object's type and memory address.
- The function is versatile and can handle various data types, including built-in types like integers, floats, lists, and dictionaries, as well as user-defined classes.
- This function does not rely on any external modules or dependencies, making it a fundamental part of Python's core functionality.
