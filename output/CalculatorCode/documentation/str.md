# Documentation for `str`

### str

**Description:**
The `str` function is a built-in Python function that converts an object into its string representation. This function is essential for transforming various data types into a format that can be easily read and manipulated as text.

**Parameters:**
- `object` (`Any`): The object to be converted into a string. This can be of any type, including numbers, lists, dictionaries, or custom objects.

**Expected Input:**
- The `object` parameter can be any Python object. There are no specific constraints on the type of object; however, the behavior of the `str` function may vary depending on the object's class and its implementation of the `__str__` method.

**Returns:**
`str`: The string representation of the provided object. If the object has a custom string representation defined by its `__str__` method, that representation will be returned. Otherwise, a default representation is generated.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When the `str` function is called, it first checks if the provided object has a `__str__` method defined. If it does, this method is invoked to obtain the string representation.
- If the object does not have a `__str__` method, the function falls back to the `__repr__` method, which provides a more formal string representation of the object, typically including type information.
- In the absence of both methods, the function returns a string that includes the object's type and its memory address.
- The `str` function is widely used throughout Python code to facilitate logging, display, and user interaction, making it a fundamental tool for developers.
