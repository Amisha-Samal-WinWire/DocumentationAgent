# Documentation for `str`

### str

**Description:**
The `str` function is a built-in Python function that converts the specified value into a string representation. It is commonly used to create a human-readable version of various data types, facilitating easier display and manipulation of data in string format.

**Parameters:**
- `object` (`Any`): The value to be converted into a string. This can be of any data type, including integers, floats, lists, dictionaries, and more.

**Expected Input:**
- The `object` parameter can be any Python object. There are no specific constraints on the type of object, as the function is designed to handle a wide variety of data types. However, the behavior of the conversion may vary depending on the type of the object being passed.

**Returns:**
`str`: A string representation of the input object. If the input is already a string, it returns the input unchanged.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `str` function first checks the type of the provided object. If the object is already a string, it simply returns it.
- For non-string objects, the function calls the `__str__()` method of the object, if it exists. This method is intended to return a string representation of the object.
- If the object does not have a `__str__()` method, the function falls back to the `__repr__()` method, which is designed to provide a more formal string representation of the object.
- The resulting string is then returned, allowing for a consistent and readable output regardless of the input type. This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates independently within the Python environment.
