### StatsService

**Description:**  
The `StatsService` class provides a suite of statistical methods for data analysis, including loading data from a database, performing regression analysis, calculating correlation matrices, conducting t-tests, and computing various statistical metrics such as standard deviation and confidence intervals. This class serves as a centralized service for statistical computations, leveraging the capabilities of the pandas and NumPy libraries.

**Parameters/Attributes:**  
- **None** (The class does not have any parameters or attributes defined in the provided context.)

**Expected Input:**  
- The methods within the `StatsService` class expect various types of input, including:
  - Lists or NumPy arrays of numerical values for statistical calculations.
  - Column names as strings for data retrieval and correlation computations.
  - DataFrames for loading and manipulating datasets.
  - Confidence levels as floats between 0 and 1 for confidence interval calculations.

**Returns:**  
- The methods return various types of outputs, including:
  - `pd.DataFrame`: For loaded datasets and correlation matrices.
  - `dict`: For regression results and descriptive statistics.
  - `Tuple[float, float]`: For t-test results and confidence intervals.
  - `List[float]`: For Z-scores.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `StatsService` class contains several key methods:
  - **_load_data**: Establishes a connection to an SQLite database and retrieves data into a pandas DataFrame based on specified column names or loads all columns if none are specified.
  - **perform_ols_regression**: Conducts Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis by computing coefficients, intercepts, R-squared values, and p-values based on the provided dependent and independent variables.
  - **calculate_correlation_matrix**: Computes the Pearson correlation coefficients for specified columns in a dataset, returning a correlation matrix as a DataFrame.
  - **perform_independent_ttest**: Executes an independent two-sample t-test to assess the statistical significance of the difference between the means of two samples, returning the t-statistic and p-value.
  - **calculate_standard_deviation**: Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers, providing insight into the variability of the dataset.
  - **calculate_descriptive_stats**: Computes key descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation) for a list of numbers and returns them in a structured dictionary.
  - **calculate_z_scores**: Determines the Z-scores for a list of numbers, indicating how many standard deviations each number is from the mean.
  - **calculate_confidence_interval**: Calculates the confidence interval for a dataset, providing a range within which the true population parameter is expected to lie based on a specified confidence level.

- Each method follows a structured approach to validate inputs, perform necessary calculations, and return results in a user-friendly format. The class relies on the pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation and statistical computations, ensuring efficient and accurate analysis.
