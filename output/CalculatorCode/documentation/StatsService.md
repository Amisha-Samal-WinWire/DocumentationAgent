# Documentation for `StatsService`

### StatsService

**Description:**
The `StatsService` class is designed to perform statistical analysis on data retrieved from a SQLite database. It provides methods for calculating various statistical metrics, including correlation, mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. The class utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and NumPy and SciPy for statistical computations, enabling efficient analysis of datasets.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `query` (`str`): A SQL query string that specifies the data to be fetched from the database.
- `dataframe` (`pandas.DataFrame`): A DataFrame that holds the data retrieved from the SQLite database.

**Expected Input:**
- `database_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement that targets the appropriate tables and columns within the database.
- The data retrieved must be suitable for statistical analysis, meaning it should contain numerical columns for calculations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return values directly; instead, it provides methods to perform statistical calculations on the data stored in the `dataframe` attribute.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `StatsService` class retrieves data from the specified SQLite database using the `data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` function, which executes the provided SQL query and returns the results as a Pandas DataFrame.
- The class includes methods for various statistical analyses:
  - **Correlation**: Uses the `df.corr()` method to compute the pairwise correlation of the DataFrame's columns.
  - **Mean**: Utilizes `np.mean()` to calculate the average of specified columns.
  - **Median**: Employs `np.median()` to find the median value of specified columns.
  - **Mode**: Calls `stats.mode()` to determine the most frequently occurring value in specified columns.
  - **Variance**: Uses `np.var()` to compute the variance of specified columns.
  - **Standard Deviation**: Leverages `np.std()` to calculate the standard deviation of specified columns.
- Each method processes the DataFrame and returns the computed statistical metric, allowing users to analyze the data effectively.
- The class handles potential exceptions related to data retrieval and statistical calculations, ensuring robust performance during analysis.
