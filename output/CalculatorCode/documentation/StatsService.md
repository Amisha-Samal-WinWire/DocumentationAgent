# Documentation for `StatsService`

### StatsService

**Description:**
The `StatsService` class is designed to provide statistical analysis functionalities on datasets retrieved from a SQLite database. It facilitates operations such as calculating means, medians, modes, standard deviations, variances, and conducting t-tests on the data. The class utilizes various statistical methods and NumPy functions to perform these analyses efficiently.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `query` (`str`): The SQL query string used to fetch data from the SQLite database.
- `data` (`pandas.DataFrame`): A DataFrame that holds the data retrieved from the database after executing the SQL query.
- `results` (`dict`): A dictionary to store the results of various statistical calculations performed by the class methods.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `query` should be a well-formed SQL query string that returns a result set compatible with conversion into a DataFrame.
- The data retrieved must contain numerical values for statistical calculations to be valid.

**Returns:**
- The class methods return various statistical results, such as means, medians, modes, standard deviations, variances, and t-test results, typically in the form of floats or dictionaries, depending on the specific method invoked.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The class initializes by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path` and executing the `query` to retrieve data as a DataFrame.
- It includes methods to calculate:
  - **Mean**: Utilizes `np.mean` to compute the average of the numerical columns in the DataFrame.
  - **Median**: Uses `np.median` to find the median value of the numerical columns.
  - **Mode**: Calls `stats.mode` to determine the most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
  - **Standard Deviation**: Employs `np.std` to measure the dispersion of the dataset.
  - **Variance**: Uses `np.var` to calculate how much the values deviate from the mean.
  - **T-tests**: Implements `stats.ttest_ind` to compare means between two independent samples, allowing for hypothesis testing.
- The class also handles exceptions and errors related to database access and data retrieval, ensuring robust performance.
- Results from statistical calculations are stored in the `results` attribute, allowing for easy access and further analysis.
