# Documentation for `isfile`

### isfile() -> bool

**Description:**
The `isfile` function checks whether a specified path points to an existing file in the filesystem. It serves as a utility to validate file paths before performing operations that require the presence of a file.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): A string representing the file path to be checked.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a valid string that represents a file path in the filesystem. The function expects this path to be formatted correctly according to the operating system's conventions (e.g., using forward slashes on Unix-like systems and backslashes on Windows).

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the specified path points to an existing file; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by taking the input `path` and checks its validity.
- It interacts with the filesystem to determine if the path exists and whether it is indeed a file, as opposed to a directory or a non-existent path.
- The function utilizes system calls or library functions that are designed to query the filesystem, ensuring efficient and accurate results.
- If the path is valid and points to a file, it returns `True`; if not, it returns `False`. This allows users to easily verify file existence before proceeding with file operations, thus preventing potential errors in file handling.
