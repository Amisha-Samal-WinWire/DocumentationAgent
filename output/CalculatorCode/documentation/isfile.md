# Documentation for `isfile`

### isfile() -> bool

**Description:**
The `isfile` function checks whether a specified path points to an existing file in the filesystem. It serves as a utility to validate file paths before performing operations that require the presence of a file.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The path to the file that needs to be checked.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a string representing the file path. It can be an absolute or relative path. The function expects the path to be formatted correctly according to the operating system's conventions.

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the specified path exists and is a file; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by verifying the existence of the path using filesystem operations.
- It checks if the path is indeed a file and not a directory or other type of filesystem object.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided path argument, ensuring a straightforward implementation focused on file validation.
