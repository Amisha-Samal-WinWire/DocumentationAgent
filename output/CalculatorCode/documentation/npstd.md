### np.std(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, ddof: int = 0, keepdims: bool = False) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of the elements in an array, which is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The standard deviation is computed using the formula that considers the degrees of freedom, allowing for both population and sample standard deviations.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or object that can be converted to an array. This is the dataset for which the standard deviation is calculated.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. By default, the standard deviation is computed over the flattened array. If an integer is provided, it computes along that specific axis. If a tuple of integers is provided, it computes along multiple axes.
- `ddof` (`int`): Delta degrees of freedom. The divisor used in the calculation is `N - ddof`, where `N` represents the number of elements. The default value is 0, which calculates the population standard deviation. Setting `ddof` to 1 calculates the sample standard deviation.
- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the output as dimensions with size one. This can be useful for broadcasting purposes. The default value is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- `a` should be an array-like structure, such as a list, tuple, or NumPy array, containing numerical values (integers or floats).
- The `axis` parameter can be an integer or a tuple of integers, specifying the axes along which to compute the standard deviation.
- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer.
- `keepdims` should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input array. If the input is multi-dimensional and `keepdims` is set to `True`, the return value will have the same number of dimensions as the input array, with the specified axes reduced to size one.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks the input array `a` to ensure it can be converted into a NumPy array.
- It then determines the axis along which to compute the standard deviation based on the provided `axis` parameter.
- The calculation of the standard deviation is performed using the formula that incorporates the `ddof` parameter, allowing for flexibility between population and sample standard deviation calculations.
- If `keepdims` is set to `True`, the output retains the original dimensions of the input array, facilitating further operations that may require consistent dimensionality.
- The function ultimately returns the computed standard deviation, which can be a single value or an array depending on the input shape and the specified axis.
