### np.std(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, ddof: int = 0, keepdims: bool = False) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of the given array or dataset. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. This function can compute the standard deviation along a specified axis and can also adjust for degrees of freedom.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or dataset for which the standard deviation is to be calculated. This can be a list, tuple, or a NumPy array.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis along which the standard deviation is computed. If `None`, the standard deviation is computed over the entire array. Default is `None`.
- `ddof` (`int`): "Delta Degrees of Freedom." The divisor used in the calculation is `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements. Default is `0`, which calculates the population standard deviation. A value of `1` calculates the sample standard deviation.
- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced dimensions are retained in the output as dimensions with size one. This can be useful for broadcasting. Default is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- `a` should be an array-like structure containing numerical data (integers or floats).
- The `axis` parameter should be an integer or `None`. If specified, it should be within the range of the dimensions of `a`.
- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer.
- `keepdims` should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input data. If the input is multi-dimensional and an axis is specified, the result will be an array of standard deviations along that axis.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks the shape and type of the input array `a` to ensure it is valid for computation.
- If an axis is specified, it computes the standard deviation along that axis. If `None`, it flattens the array and computes the standard deviation for all elements.
- The function applies the formula for standard deviation, which involves calculating the mean of the dataset, then determining the squared differences from the mean, averaging those squared differences, and finally taking the square root of that average.
- The `ddof` parameter adjusts the divisor in the standard deviation calculation, allowing for differentiation between population and sample standard deviation.
- The output is shaped according to the `keepdims` parameter, ensuring compatibility for further operations in a NumPy context.
