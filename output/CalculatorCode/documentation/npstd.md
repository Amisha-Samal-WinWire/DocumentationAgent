### np.std(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, ddof: int = 0, keepdims: bool = False) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of the elements in an array, providing a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The standard deviation is computed as the square root of the variance, which quantifies how much the values deviate from the mean.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or object that can be converted to an array. This is the dataset for which the standard deviation is calculated.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. By default, the standard deviation is computed over the flattened array.
- `ddof` (`int`): "Delta Degrees of Freedom." The divisor used in the calculation of the standard deviation is `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements. The default value is 0, which calculates the population standard deviation.
- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the result as dimensions with size one. This is useful for broadcasting.

**Expected Input:**
- `a` should be an array-like structure (e.g., list, tuple, NumPy array) containing numerical data.
- The `axis` parameter can be an integer or a tuple of integers specifying the axes along which to compute the standard deviation. If `None`, the standard deviation is computed over the entire array.
- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer, typically 0 for population standard deviation or 1 for sample standard deviation.
- `keepdims` should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input array, which represents the dispersion of the dataset. If the input is multi-dimensional and `keepdims` is set to `True`, the output will maintain the dimensions of the input array.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by converting the input data into a NumPy array if it is not already in that format.
- It then checks the specified `axis` to determine whether to compute the standard deviation across the entire array or along specified dimensions.
- The function calculates the mean of the array elements, then computes the variance by averaging the squared differences from the mean.
- The standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- If `ddof` is specified, it adjusts the divisor in the variance calculation accordingly.
- Finally, if `keepdims` is set to `True`, the function reshapes the output to maintain the original dimensions of the input array, allowing for easier integration with other operations.
