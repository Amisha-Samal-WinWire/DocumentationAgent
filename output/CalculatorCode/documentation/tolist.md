# Documentation for `tolist`

### tolist()

**Description:**
The `tolist` function is designed to convert a data structure, such as an array or a collection, into a standard list format. This function facilitates the manipulation and handling of data by ensuring that the output is consistently in list form, which is a widely used data structure in many programming contexts.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to accept a variety of data structures, including arrays, tuples, or other iterable collections. It should be able to handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous data types within these structures.

**Returns:**
`list`: The function returns a list representation of the input data structure. This list will contain all elements from the original structure in the same order.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `tolist` function begins by checking the type of the input data structure. If the input is already a list, it may return the input directly to avoid unnecessary conversions.
- If the input is an array or another iterable type, the function iterates through the elements, appending each one to a new list.
- The function ensures that any nested structures are flattened appropriately, if applicable, to provide a single-level list output.
- Finally, the constructed list is returned, allowing for easy integration with other functions or operations that require list inputs. 

This function operates independently without any internal dependencies, making it a straightforward utility for data conversion tasks.
