# Documentation for `tolist`

### tolist()

**Description:**
The `tolist` function is designed to convert a data structure, such as an array or a collection, into a standard list format. This transformation is useful for ensuring compatibility with functions or libraries that require list inputs, allowing for easier manipulation and processing of the data.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to handle various data structures, including but not limited to arrays, tuples, or other iterable collections. The specific type of input is not restricted, but it should be an iterable object that can be converted into a list.

**Returns:**
`list`: The function returns a new list containing the elements of the input data structure. If the input is already a list, it may return a shallow copy of that list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking the type of the input data structure to determine if it is already a list. If it is, the function may create a shallow copy to avoid modifying the original list.
- If the input is not a list, the function iterates over the elements of the input data structure, collecting them into a new list.
- The resulting list is then returned to the caller, ensuring that the output is always in list format, regardless of the input type.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided input, making it straightforward and efficient for converting various iterable types to lists.
