# Documentation for `tolist`

### tolist()

**Description:**
The `tolist` function is designed to convert a data structure, such as an array or a collection, into a standard Python list. This function facilitates the transformation of various iterable types into a uniform list format, making it easier to work with the data in subsequent operations.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a single iterable input (e.g., an array, tuple, or any other collection type). The specific type of the input may vary, but it should be an object that can be iterated over. If the input is not iterable, the function may raise an error.

**Returns:**
`list`: The function returns a new list containing all elements from the provided iterable. If the input is already a list, it will return a shallow copy of that list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking the type of the input to determine if it is already a list. If it is, it creates and returns a shallow copy of the list to ensure that the original data structure remains unchanged.
- If the input is not a list, the function iterates over the elements of the input iterable and appends each element to a new list.
- The final result is a list that contains all elements from the input iterable, preserving the order of the elements as they appeared in the original structure.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided input, ensuring that it is lightweight and efficient.
