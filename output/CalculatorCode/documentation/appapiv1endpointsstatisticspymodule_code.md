### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a part of the API routing mechanism within the FastAPI framework. It is responsible for defining and organizing the endpoints related to statistical operations in the application. This module acts as a central point for handling requests and responses associated with statistical data processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This module does not directly accept input parameters as it primarily sets up API routes. However, the endpoints defined within this module will expect specific input data formats (e.g., JSON) when invoked through HTTP requests.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` utilizes the `APIRouter` from the FastAPI framework to create a new router instance. This instance is used to define various statistical endpoints that can handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- Each endpoint defined within this module will typically include logic to process incoming requests, validate input data, and return appropriate responses, often involving statistical calculations or data retrieval.
- The module may also include middleware or dependencies that enhance the functionality of the endpoints, such as authentication or data validation.
- Overall, the `module_code` acts as a foundational component for the statistical API, ensuring that all related endpoints are properly registered and accessible within the application.

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component for defining and managing API endpoints related to statistical operations within the web application. It utilizes the `APIRouter` class to facilitate the organization of routes, ensuring that requests for statistical data are efficiently handled and routed to the appropriate functions.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not define any parameters or attributes.

**Expected Input:**
- The `module_code` is expected to be integrated within a web application context where it will handle HTTP requests related to statistical data. The specific routes and their corresponding handler functions will be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not return any value upon execution.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of the `APIRouter`, which is responsible for managing the API routes.
- It defines various endpoints that correspond to statistical operations, such as retrieving or processing statistical data.
- Each endpoint is associated with specific HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) and paths, allowing the application to respond to incoming requests appropriately.
- The router matches incoming requests to the defined endpoints, ensuring that the correct handler functions are invoked based on the request's method and path.
- Overall, the `module_code` acts as a facilitator for organizing and managing the statistical API endpoints, leveraging the capabilities of the `APIRouter` to streamline request handling and routing.
