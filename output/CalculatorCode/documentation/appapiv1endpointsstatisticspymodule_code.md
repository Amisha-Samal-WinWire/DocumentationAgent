# Documentation for `app\api\v1\endpoints\statistics.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central module for defining and managing API endpoints related to statistical operations within the application. It utilizes the `APIRouter` class to streamline the creation of RESTful routes, allowing for efficient handling of requests and responses pertaining to statistical data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module is expected to define various API routes that will handle incoming requests related to statistics. The specific input for each endpoint will depend on the individual route definitions that are added to the `APIRouter`.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of the `APIRouter`, which acts as a container for the statistical endpoints.
- It defines various routes that correspond to different statistical operations, such as retrieving statistical summaries, generating reports, or processing data.
- Each route is associated with a specific HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and a corresponding handler function that processes the request and returns the appropriate response.
- The `APIRouter` manages the routing logic, matching incoming requests to the defined endpoints and invoking the correct handler functions.
- This modular approach allows for organized and maintainable code, facilitating the addition of new statistical endpoints as needed.
