# Documentation for `app\api\v1\endpoints\statistics.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component for defining and managing API endpoints related to statistical operations within the web application. It utilizes the `APIRouter` class to facilitate the organization of routes, ensuring that requests for statistical data are efficiently handled and routed to the appropriate functions.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not define any parameters or attributes.

**Expected Input:**
- The `module_code` is expected to be integrated within a web application context where it will handle HTTP requests related to statistical data. The specific routes and their corresponding handler functions will be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not return any value upon execution.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of the `APIRouter`, which is responsible for managing the API routes.
- It defines various endpoints that correspond to statistical operations, such as retrieving or processing statistical data.
- Each endpoint is associated with specific HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) and paths, allowing the application to respond to incoming requests appropriately.
- The router matches incoming requests to the defined endpoints, ensuring that the correct handler functions are invoked based on the request's method and path.
- Overall, the `module_code` acts as a facilitator for organizing and managing the statistical API endpoints, leveraging the capabilities of the `APIRouter` to streamline request handling and routing.
