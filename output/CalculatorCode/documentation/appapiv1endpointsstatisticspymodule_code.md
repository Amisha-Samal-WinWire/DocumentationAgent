# Documentation for `app\api\v1\endpoints\statistics.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component within the `statistics.py` file, which is part of the API endpoints for the application. This module is responsible for defining and managing the various statistical endpoints that the application exposes, facilitating the retrieval and processing of statistical data through structured API requests.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `module_code` is expected to handle incoming API requests that may include various parameters related to statistical queries. These inputs typically consist of query parameters or request bodies that specify the type of statistical data requested, such as metrics, dimensions, or filters.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` utilizes the `APIRouter` class to define routes for statistical endpoints. It registers specific paths and associates them with HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) that correspond to the operations for retrieving or manipulating statistical data.
- Upon receiving an API request, the `module_code` interacts with the `APIRouter` to determine the appropriate handler for the request based on the defined routes. This involves checking the request's path and method against the registered endpoints.
- The module may also incorporate middleware functionalities for tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling, ensuring that requests are processed efficiently and securely.
- Overall, the `module_code` acts as an intermediary that connects incoming statistical requests to the underlying application logic, enabling the retrieval and processing of statistical information in a structured manner.
