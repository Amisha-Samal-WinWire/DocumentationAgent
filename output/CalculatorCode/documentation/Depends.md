# Documentation for `Depends`

### Depends

**Description:**
The `Depends` function is a utility designed to facilitate dependency injection in applications. It allows for the dynamic resolution of dependencies at runtime, enabling more flexible and maintainable code structures. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where components need to be decoupled from their dependencies, allowing for easier testing and configuration.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- None: The `Depends` function does not require any input parameters. It is typically used in conjunction with other components that specify their dependencies.

**Returns:**
- `Any`: The function returns an instance of the dependency that is being resolved. The exact type of the return value depends on the specific dependency being injected.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Depends` function operates by leveraging a registry or container that holds references to various dependencies. When invoked, it checks this registry to find the appropriate instance of the requested dependency.
- If the dependency is not already instantiated, the function may create a new instance based on the configuration provided in the registry.
- This process allows for the automatic resolution of dependencies, reducing the need for manual instantiation and configuration throughout the codebase.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility that can be integrated into various parts of an application without additional overhead.
