# Documentation for `Depends`

### Depends

**Description:**
The `Depends` function is designed to facilitate dependency injection in a software application. It allows for the specification of dependencies that a particular component or function requires to operate correctly. This is particularly useful in frameworks that utilize inversion of control, enabling better modularity and testability of code.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `Depends` function does not take any direct input parameters. Instead, it is typically used in conjunction with other functions or classes that require dependencies to be injected.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return a value. Its primary purpose is to register or resolve dependencies within the application context.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Depends` function operates by marking a specific dependency that a component or function relies on. When invoked, it registers this dependency within a dependency injection container or context.
- The function may interact with a broader framework that manages the lifecycle and resolution of dependencies, ensuring that the correct instances are provided when needed.
- It does not contain any internal logic or computations, as its role is primarily declarative, indicating to the framework which dependencies are required for the associated components.

This function is essential for applications that follow the principles of dependency injection, promoting loose coupling and enhancing the maintainability of the codebase.
