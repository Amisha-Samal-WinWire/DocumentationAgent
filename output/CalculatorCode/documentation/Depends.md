# Documentation for `Depends`

### Depends

**Description:**
`Depends` is an external function designed to facilitate dependency injection in a software application. It allows for the dynamic resolution of dependencies, enabling components to receive their required dependencies at runtime rather than at compile time. This promotes loose coupling and enhances testability by allowing mock dependencies to be injected during testing.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None

**Returns:**
`Depends`: An instance or reference that represents the resolved dependency. The exact type of the returned object may vary depending on the context in which `Depends` is used.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Depends` function does not have any internal dependencies, which means it operates independently of other components within the codebase.
- When invoked, `Depends` typically interacts with a dependency injection framework or container, which manages the lifecycle and resolution of dependencies.
- The function may utilize reflection or configuration settings to determine which dependencies to provide based on the context in which it is called.
- The primary goal of `Depends` is to streamline the process of obtaining dependencies, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code by reducing direct instantiation of dependencies within classes or functions.
