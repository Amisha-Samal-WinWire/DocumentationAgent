### CalculationError

**Description:**
`CalculationError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors that occur during mathematical calculations within the application. It extends the base exception class to provide a specific error type that can be raised when a calculation fails, allowing for more precise error handling in the codebase.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. It can be raised with or without a message, depending on the context in which it is used.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, utilizing `super().__init__()` to initialize the base class. This allows it to function as a standard exception while providing a specific context for calculation-related errors.
- When raised, it can carry an optional error message that describes the nature of the calculation failure, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- This class is intended to be used within the application wherever a calculation error needs to be signaled, enabling developers to catch and handle these specific exceptions separately from other types of errors.
