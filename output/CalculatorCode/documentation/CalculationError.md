### CalculationError

**Description:**
`CalculationError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors specifically related to calculation processes within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised in scenarios where a calculation fails due to invalid input or other unforeseen issues.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is typically used in conjunction with error messages or other exception handling mechanisms that provide context about the calculation failure.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class inherits from a base exception class, utilizing the `super().__init__` method to initialize the exception. This allows it to integrate seamlessly into Python's exception handling framework.
- When raised, it can provide a specific error message that describes the nature of the calculation error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- This class is intended to be used within the broader application to signal calculation-related issues, ensuring that such errors can be caught and handled appropriately by the calling code.

**Dependencies:**
- `super().__init__`
### CalculationError

**Description:**
`CalculationError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors that occur during mathematical calculations within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised in scenarios where a calculation fails, providing a clear indication of the nature of the error.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation, as it inherits from a base exception class. However, it can be raised with an optional message that describes the error.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class utilizes the `super().__init__` method to initialize the base exception class. This allows it to inherit all the properties and methods of standard exception classes in Python.
- When an instance of `CalculationError` is created, it can optionally take a message that describes the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- This class serves as a specialized exception, making it easier for developers to catch and handle calculation-related errors distinctly from other types of exceptions in the codebase.
