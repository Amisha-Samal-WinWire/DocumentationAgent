### CalculationError

**Description:**
The `CalculationError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur during mathematical calculations within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling related to calculation failures.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not take any specific input parameters upon instantiation. It is typically raised with an optional message that describes the nature of the calculation error.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class using `super().__init__()`, which initializes the base class with any provided arguments.
- When an instance of `CalculationError` is raised, it can include a message that provides context about the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- This class is intended to be used in scenarios where a calculation fails, allowing developers to catch this specific type of error and handle it appropriately in their code.
