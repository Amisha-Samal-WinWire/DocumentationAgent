### CalculationError

**Description:**
`CalculationError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors that occur during mathematical calculations within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised in scenarios where a calculation fails, providing a clear indication of the nature of the error.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation, as it inherits from a base exception class. However, it can be raised with an optional message that describes the error.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class utilizes the `super().__init__` method to initialize the base exception class. This allows it to inherit all the properties and methods of standard exception classes in Python.
- When an instance of `CalculationError` is created, it can optionally take a message that describes the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- This class serves as a specialized exception, making it easier for developers to catch and handle calculation-related errors distinctly from other types of exceptions in the codebase.
