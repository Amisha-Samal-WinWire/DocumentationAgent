# Documentation for `self.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### get_dataframe_from_sqlite() 

**Description:**
Retrieves data from a SQLite database and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame. This function facilitates the extraction of structured data from a SQLite database, allowing for further analysis and manipulation using the Pandas library.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): A SQL query string that specifies the data to be retrieved from the SQLite database.
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be fetched.

**Expected Input:**
- `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement that can be executed against the specified SQLite database.
- `db_path` should be a string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. The path must be accessible and the database must be in a readable state.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. If the query returns no results, an empty DataFrame will be returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path`.
- It then executes the SQL query specified in the `query` parameter.
- The results of the query are fetched and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the function closes the database connection and returns the DataFrame containing the queried data.
- This function leverages the Pandas library for data manipulation and assumes that the necessary libraries for SQLite and Pandas are imported and available in the environment.
