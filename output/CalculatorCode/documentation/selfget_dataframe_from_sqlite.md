# Documentation for `self.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### get_dataframe_from_sqlite()

**Description:**
Retrieves a DataFrame from a SQLite database. This function is designed to execute a SQL query against a specified SQLite database and return the results in a structured format, specifically as a pandas DataFrame. This allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data retrieved from the database.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): The SQL query string that will be executed against the SQLite database.
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.

**Expected Input:**
- `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement that can be executed on the specified SQLite database.
- `database_path` should be a string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. The path must be accessible and the database must be in a readable state.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. If the query returns no results, an empty DataFrame is returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `database_path`.
- It then executes the SQL `query` against the database.
- The results of the query are fetched and converted into a pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the function closes the database connection and returns the DataFrame containing the query results.
- Error handling may be implemented to manage potential issues such as invalid SQL syntax or connection failures, ensuring that the function behaves robustly in various scenarios.
