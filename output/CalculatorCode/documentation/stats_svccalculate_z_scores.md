# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_z_scores`

### calculate_z_scores() -> List[float]

**Description:**
Calculates the z-scores for a given dataset. A z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset. This function is typically used in statistical analysis to identify outliers or to standardize data for further analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats or integers. The values should be numerical and can include both positive and negative numbers. The function assumes that the list contains at least two elements to compute a meaningful mean and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`List[float]`: A list of z-scores corresponding to each value in the input dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first calculates the mean of the input dataset.
- It then computes the standard deviation of the dataset.
- For each value in the dataset, the function calculates the z-score using the formula: \( z = \frac{(X - \text{mean})}{\text{std\_dev}} \), where \( X \) is the value from the dataset.
- The resulting z-scores are collected into a list and returned.
- This function does not rely on any external modules, but utilizes basic arithmetic operations to perform the calculations.
