# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_z_scores`

### calculate_z_scores() -> List[float]

**Description:**
Calculates the z-scores for a given dataset. A z-score indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset. This function is useful for standardizing data, which can be particularly helpful in statistical analysis and machine learning applications.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats or integers. The values can be positive, negative, or zero, but the list must contain at least one element to compute the mean and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`List[float]`: A list of z-scores corresponding to each value in the input dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first computes the mean of the input dataset.
- It then calculates the standard deviation of the dataset.
- For each value in the dataset, the function computes the z-score using the formula: \( z = \frac{(X - \text{mean})}{\text{std\_dev}} \), where \( X \) is the value from the dataset.
- The resulting z-scores are collected into a list and returned.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided dataset.
