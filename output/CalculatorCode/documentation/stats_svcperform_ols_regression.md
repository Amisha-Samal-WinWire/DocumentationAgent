### stats_svc.perform_ols_regression()

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` function is designed to execute Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis on a given dataset. This statistical method is used to estimate the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The function computes the regression coefficients, which represent the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, and provides insights into the data's underlying patterns.

**Parameters:**
- `dependent_var` (`str`): The name of the dependent variable (the outcome variable) in the dataset.
- `independent_vars` (`list` of `str`): A list of names of the independent variables (predictors) to be included in the regression model.
- `data` (`DataFrame`): A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset on which the regression analysis will be performed.

**Expected Input:**
- `dependent_var` should be a string that corresponds to a column name in the provided DataFrame, representing the variable to be predicted.
- `independent_vars` should be a list of strings, each representing a column name in the DataFrame that will be used as predictors. The list can be empty if no independent variables are specified, but at least one independent variable is typically required for meaningful analysis.
- `data` must be a pandas DataFrame that contains the columns specified in `dependent_var` and `independent_vars`. The DataFrame should not contain missing values in these columns to ensure accurate regression results.

**Returns:**
`RegressionResults`: An object containing the results of the OLS regression analysis, including coefficients, statistical significance, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure that the specified dependent and independent variables exist within the provided DataFrame.
- It then constructs the regression model using the OLS method from a statistical library (such as `statsmodels`).
- The model is fitted to the data, which involves calculating the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.
- After fitting the model, the function extracts key statistics from the regression results, including coefficients for each independent variable, p-values for hypothesis testing, and R-squared values to assess the model's explanatory power.
- Finally, the function returns the regression results object, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.
