# Documentation for `stats_svc.perform_ols_regression`

### stats_svc.perform_ols_regression()

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` function performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis on a given dataset. This statistical method is used to estimate the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The function computes the regression coefficients, which indicate the strength and direction of the relationships, and provides insights into how well the independent variables predict the dependent variable.

**Parameters:**
- `dependent_var` (`str`): The name of the dependent variable (the outcome variable) in the dataset.
- `independent_vars` (`list[str]`): A list of names of the independent variables (predictor variables) to be included in the regression model.
- `data` (`DataFrame`): A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset on which the regression analysis will be performed. This DataFrame must include columns corresponding to both the dependent and independent variables.

**Expected Input:**
- `dependent_var` must be a string that matches a column name in the provided DataFrame.
- `independent_vars` should be a list of strings, each representing a valid column name in the DataFrame.
- `data` must be a pandas DataFrame with appropriate data types for regression analysis (e.g., numeric types for independent variables).

**Returns:**
`RegressionResults`: An object containing the results of the OLS regression analysis, including coefficients, statistical significance, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure that the dependent variable and independent variables are present in the provided DataFrame.
- It then constructs the regression model using the specified dependent and independent variables.
- The OLS regression is performed using a statistical library (such as statsmodels), which computes the regression coefficients and other relevant statistics.
- Finally, the function returns an object encapsulating the results of the regression analysis, allowing users to interpret the findings and assess the model's performance. 

This function does not have any internal dependencies and relies solely on the provided input data to execute the regression analysis.
