### stats_svc.perform_ols_regression()

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` function is designed to execute Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis on a given dataset. This statistical method is used to estimate the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The function computes the regression coefficients, which indicate the strength and direction of the relationships, and may also provide additional statistical metrics related to the regression model.

**Parameters:**
- `None`: This function does not take any parameters.

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to operate on a dataset that is structured appropriately for OLS regression. This typically includes:
  - A dependent variable (the outcome variable).
  - One or more independent variables (predictors).
- The dataset should be in a format that the function can process, such as a DataFrame or a similar data structure that allows for numerical computations.

**Returns:**
- `RegressionResults`: The function returns an object that encapsulates the results of the OLS regression analysis. This object typically includes:
  - Coefficients for each independent variable.
  - Statistical metrics such as R-squared, p-values, and confidence intervals.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it meets the requirements for OLS regression.
- It then sets up the regression model, specifying the dependent and independent variables.
- The core of the function involves applying the OLS algorithm, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values.
- After fitting the model, the function extracts the regression coefficients and relevant statistical metrics.
- Finally, it returns the results encapsulated in a structured format, allowing users to interpret the regression analysis effectively.

This function does not have any internal dependencies, relying solely on its own logic to perform the regression analysis.
