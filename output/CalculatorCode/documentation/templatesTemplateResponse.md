# Documentation for `templates.TemplateResponse`

### templates.TemplateResponse

**Description:**
`TemplateResponse` is a class designed to facilitate the rendering of templates in web applications. It serves as a response object that combines a template with a context, allowing for dynamic content generation based on the provided data. This class is typically used in web frameworks to return HTML responses that are generated from templates.

**Parameters:**
- `template_name` (`str`): The name of the template file to be rendered.
- `context` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the context data that will be passed to the template for rendering.
- `status_code` (`int`, optional): An HTTP status code to be returned with the response. Defaults to 200 (OK).
- `headers` (`dict`, optional): A dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the response.

**Expected Input:**
- `template_name` should be a valid string representing the path or name of the template file.
- `context` must be a dictionary containing key-value pairs that the template will use to generate dynamic content.
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- `headers` should be a dictionary of strings representing HTTP headers.

**Returns:**
`TemplateResponse`: An instance of `TemplateResponse` that encapsulates the rendered template and the associated context, ready to be returned as an HTTP response.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `TemplateResponse` initializes with the provided `template_name`, `context`, `status_code`, and `headers`.
- The class typically includes methods to render the template using the specified context, which involves loading the template file and substituting placeholders with actual data from the context dictionary.
- The response object can be further customized with additional headers or status codes before being sent to the client.
- The rendering process may involve calling external template engines or libraries, depending on the web framework in use, to process the template and generate the final HTML output.
- This class is designed to integrate seamlessly with web frameworks, allowing for efficient and organized handling of template rendering and HTTP responses.
