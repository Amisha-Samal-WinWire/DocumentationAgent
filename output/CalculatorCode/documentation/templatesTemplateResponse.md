# Documentation for `templates.TemplateResponse`

### templates.TemplateResponse

**Description:**
`TemplateResponse` is a class designed to facilitate the rendering of templates in a web application context. It serves as a response object that combines both the rendered content of a specified template and any additional context data needed for rendering. This class is particularly useful in web frameworks that utilize templating engines to generate dynamic HTML responses based on server-side logic.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `template_name` (`str`): The name of the template file to be rendered.
- `context` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the context data that will be passed to the template during rendering. This data is used to populate dynamic content within the template.
- `status_code` (`int`, optional): An HTTP status code to be returned with the response. Defaults to 200 (OK).
- `headers` (`dict`, optional): A dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the response. This allows for customization of the response headers.

**Expected Input:**
- `template_name` should be a valid string representing the filename of the template to be rendered. It must correspond to a template that exists within the configured template directories.
- `context` should be a dictionary containing key-value pairs where keys are variable names used in the template, and values are the data to be rendered.
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- `headers` should be a dictionary with valid HTTP header fields and values.

**Returns:**
`TemplateResponse`: An instance of the `TemplateResponse` class that encapsulates the rendered template content and the associated HTTP response details.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `TemplateResponse` class initializes with the provided `template_name`, `context`, `status_code`, and `headers`.
- The class typically includes methods to render the specified template using the provided context. This involves locating the template file, processing it with the templating engine, and generating the final HTML output.
- The response object can also handle the setting of HTTP headers and status codes, ensuring that the response sent back to the client is properly formatted and includes any necessary metadata.
- The rendering process may involve calling external templating functions or libraries, which take the template and context as inputs and return the final rendered output.
- This class is designed to be used within a web framework, allowing for seamless integration with routing and request handling mechanisms.
