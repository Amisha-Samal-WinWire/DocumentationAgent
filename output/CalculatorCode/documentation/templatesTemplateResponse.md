# Documentation for `templates.TemplateResponse`

### templates.TemplateResponse

**Description:**
`TemplateResponse` is a class designed to facilitate the rendering of templates in web applications. It serves as a response object that combines a template with context data, allowing for dynamic content generation based on user requests. This class is typically used in web frameworks to return HTML responses that are generated from templates, enabling developers to separate presentation logic from business logic.

**Parameters:**
- `template_name` (`str`): The name of the template file to be rendered.
- `context` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the context data to be passed to the template for rendering.
- `status_code` (`int`, optional): An HTTP status code to be returned with the response. Defaults to 200 (OK).
- `headers` (`dict`, optional): A dictionary of HTTP headers to include in the response. Defaults to an empty dictionary.

**Expected Input:**
- `template_name` should be a string that corresponds to the name of a valid template file.
- `context` should be a dictionary containing key-value pairs that represent the data to be rendered in the template.
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- `headers` should be a dictionary with valid HTTP header fields.

**Returns:**
`TemplateResponse`: An instance of `TemplateResponse` that encapsulates the template and context data, ready to be processed and returned as an HTTP response.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `TemplateResponse` class initializes with the provided `template_name`, `context`, `status_code`, and `headers`.
- The class typically includes methods to render the template using the provided context, which may involve looking up the template file, processing it with a templating engine, and merging it with the context data.
- The final output is an HTML response that can be sent back to the client, along with any specified HTTP headers and status codes.
- This class is designed to work seamlessly within web frameworks, allowing for easy integration with routing and request handling mechanisms. It does not have any internal dependencies, relying instead on the templating engine and the web framework's response handling capabilities.
