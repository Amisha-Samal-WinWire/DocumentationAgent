# Documentation for `calculate_std_deviation`

### calculate_std_deviation(data: List[float]) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a given dataset, which is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The standard deviation provides insight into how much individual data points deviate from the mean (average) of the dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a list containing at least one numerical value (float or int). The list must not be empty, and all elements should be numeric; otherwise, the function may raise an error or return a specific value indicating invalid input.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input dataset, representing the average distance of each data point from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it contains valid numerical values.
- It calculates the mean (average) of the dataset.
- The function then computes the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- It calculates the variance by averaging these squared differences.
- Finally, the standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- This function relies on the `calculate_standard_deviation` method from the `stats_svc` module to perform the actual calculation, ensuring that the logic for standard deviation computation is encapsulated and reusable.
