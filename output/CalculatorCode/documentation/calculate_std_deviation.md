### calculate_std_deviation(data: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. This function is essential for statistical analysis, providing a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a list containing numerical values. It is important that the list is not empty, as calculating the standard deviation of an empty list is undefined and may lead to an error.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input list, represented as a floating-point number. This value indicates how much the individual numbers in the list deviate from the mean of the list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `calculate_standard_deviation` method from the `StatsService` class, which computes the standard deviation using the NumPy library's `np.std()` function.
- The standard deviation is calculated by first determining the mean of the data, then computing the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean.
- The result is returned as a floating-point number, which provides a clear representation of the variability within the dataset.
- This function is designed to be used within an API context, where it may be called upon to process statistical requests, and it may raise an `APIException` if the input data is invalid or if an error occurs during processing.

### calculate_std_deviation() -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a dataset, which is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The standard deviation provides insight into how much individual data points deviate from the mean (average) of the dataset.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically provided as a list or array of numerical values. The dataset must contain at least one numeric value to compute the standard deviation. If the dataset is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function may raise an error or return an undefined result.

**Returns:**
`float`: The calculated standard deviation of the dataset. This value indicates the average distance of each data point from the mean, reflecting the variability within the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by calculating the mean of the dataset.
- It then computes the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- The average of these squared differences is calculated to determine the variance.
- Finally, the standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and performs all calculations using basic arithmetic operations. It is typically invoked within an API endpoint that handles statistical calculations, allowing it to process incoming data and return the computed standard deviation to the client.
