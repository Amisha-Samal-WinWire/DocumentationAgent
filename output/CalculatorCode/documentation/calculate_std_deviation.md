# Documentation for `calculate_std_deviation`

### calculate_std_deviation() -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a dataset, which is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. The standard deviation provides insight into how much individual data points deviate from the mean (average) of the dataset.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically provided as a list or array of numerical values. The dataset must contain at least one numeric value to compute the standard deviation. If the dataset is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function may raise an error or return an undefined result.

**Returns:**
`float`: The calculated standard deviation of the dataset. This value indicates the average distance of each data point from the mean, reflecting the variability within the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by calculating the mean of the dataset.
- It then computes the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- The average of these squared differences is calculated to determine the variance.
- Finally, the standard deviation is obtained by taking the square root of the variance.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and performs all calculations using basic arithmetic operations. It is typically invoked within an API endpoint that handles statistical calculations, allowing it to process incoming data and return the computed standard deviation to the client.
