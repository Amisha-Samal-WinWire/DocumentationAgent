# Documentation for `calculate_std_deviation`

### calculate_std_deviation(data: List[float]) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a given dataset, which quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in the values. A lower standard deviation indicates that the values are clustered closely around the mean, while a higher standard deviation signifies that the values are more spread out.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a list containing at least one numeric value (float or int). The list must not be empty, and all elements should be numeric; otherwise, the function may raise an error or return an undefined result.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the input dataset, representing the dispersion of the values around the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it contains numeric values.
- It calculates the mean (average) of the dataset.
- The variance is computed by averaging the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- Finally, the standard deviation is derived by taking the square root of the variance.
- This function relies on the `calculate_standard_deviation` function from the `stats_svc` module to perform the actual calculation, ensuring that all mathematical operations are handled efficiently and accurately.
