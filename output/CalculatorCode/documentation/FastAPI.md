# Documentation for `FastAPI`

### FastAPI

**Description:**
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to create RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently, leveraging asynchronous programming capabilities. FastAPI automatically validates request data, generates interactive API documentation, and supports dependency injection, making it a powerful tool for developers.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
FastAPI expects input in the form of HTTP requests, which can include various types of data such as JSON, form data, and query parameters. The framework utilizes Python type hints to define the expected data types for request parameters, allowing for automatic validation and serialization. The input data should conform to the specified types and structures defined in the API endpoints.

**Returns:**
FastAPI returns responses in the form of HTTP responses, which can include JSON data, HTML content, or other media types. The return type is typically inferred from the endpoint's function signature, and FastAPI automatically serializes the output based on the defined response model.

**Detailed Logic:**
- FastAPI uses Python's type hints to define the structure and types of request parameters, enabling automatic data validation and serialization.
- When a request is received, FastAPI processes the incoming data, validates it against the defined types, and converts it into Python objects.
- The framework supports asynchronous programming, allowing for non-blocking I/O operations, which enhances performance, especially under high load.
- FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using OpenAPI and Swagger UI, providing a user-friendly interface for testing and exploring the API.
- The framework also supports dependency injection, allowing for the easy management of shared resources, such as database connections or authentication mechanisms, across different endpoints.
- FastAPI is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts, ensuring high performance and data validation capabilities.
