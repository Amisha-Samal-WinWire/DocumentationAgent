# Documentation for `FastAPI`

### FastAPI

**Description:**
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to create RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently, leveraging asynchronous programming capabilities and automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
FastAPI expects input in the form of HTTP requests, which can include various data types such as JSON, form data, and query parameters. The framework utilizes Python type hints to validate and serialize input data automatically. It is designed to handle both synchronous and asynchronous requests, allowing for high concurrency.

**Returns:**
FastAPI returns HTTP responses, which can include various content types such as JSON, HTML, or plain text. The response format is determined by the endpoint's implementation and the data returned from the view functions.

**Detailed Logic:**
- FastAPI utilizes Python type hints to define the expected input and output types for API endpoints, enabling automatic data validation and serialization.
- It supports asynchronous request handling, allowing for non-blocking I/O operations, which is particularly useful for high-load applications.
- The framework automatically generates OpenAPI documentation based on the defined endpoints and their parameters, making it easy for developers to understand and interact with the API.
- FastAPI integrates with various data validation libraries, such as Pydantic, to ensure that incoming data adheres to the specified types and constraints.
- The framework is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts, ensuring a robust and efficient architecture.
