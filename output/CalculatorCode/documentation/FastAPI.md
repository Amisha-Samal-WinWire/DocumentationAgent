# Documentation for `FastAPI`

### FastAPI

**Description:**
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to create RESTful APIs quickly and efficiently, leveraging asynchronous programming capabilities to handle multiple requests simultaneously. FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation and supports data validation, serialization, and deserialization using Pydantic models.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
FastAPI expects input in the form of HTTP requests, which can include various types of data such as JSON, form data, and query parameters. The framework uses Python type hints to validate and parse incoming data, ensuring that it adheres to specified formats and types.

**Returns:**
FastAPI returns HTTP responses, which can include JSON data, HTML content, or other types of responses based on the defined routes and endpoints. The return type can vary depending on the endpoint's implementation and the data being processed.

**Detailed Logic:**
- FastAPI utilizes Python's type hints to define the expected input and output types for API endpoints, allowing for automatic data validation and serialization.
- When a request is made to an endpoint, FastAPI parses the incoming data according to the specified types and validates it against the defined Pydantic models.
- The framework supports asynchronous request handling, enabling it to manage multiple requests concurrently without blocking.
- FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc, providing a user-friendly interface for testing and exploring the API.
- It integrates seamlessly with other Python libraries and frameworks, allowing for easy extension and customization of the API functionality.
