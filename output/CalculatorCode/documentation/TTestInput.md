# Documentation for `TTestInput`

### TTestInput

**Description:**
`TTestInput` is a model class designed to represent the input data required for performing an independent t-test. It includes validation mechanisms to ensure that the samples provided for the test are not identical, which is a prerequisite for the validity of the t-test.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `TTestInput` class does not define any explicit parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to receive two or more samples of data for comparison. Each sample should be a collection of numerical values (e.g., lists or arrays) that represent the groups being tested. The samples must be distinct; identical samples will trigger validation errors.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any values upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a structured representation of the input data for the t-test.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `TTestInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides foundational functionality and attributes common to all models in the application.
- The class likely includes validation logic that checks the provided samples for identity. If the samples are found to be identical, a validation error is raised, potentially using the `ValueError` exception to indicate the issue.
- The validation process ensures that the input adheres to the requirements of the independent t-test, thereby maintaining data integrity and preventing erroneous statistical analysis.
- The class may also utilize the `Field` class to define the characteristics of the input fields, although specific implementations are not detailed in the provided context. 

This structure allows `TTestInput` to effectively manage and validate the input data necessary for conducting independent t-tests, ensuring that the statistical analysis performed is based on appropriate and valid data.
