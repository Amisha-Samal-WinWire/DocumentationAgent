### TTestInput

**Description:**
`TTestInput` is a model designed for performing an independent t-test, a statistical method used to determine if there are significant differences between the means of two independent samples. This class includes validation to ensure that the samples provided for the t-test are not identical, which is a prerequisite for the test's assumptions.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `sample1` (`List[float]`): The first sample of data points for the t-test.
- `sample2` (`List[float]`): The second sample of data points for the t-test.

**Expected Input:**
- `sample1` and `sample2` should be lists of floating-point numbers representing the data points of the two independent samples.
- Both samples must contain at least one data point.
- The samples must not be identical; if they are, a validation error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but raises exceptions if validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `TTestInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides foundational functionality for model validation.
- It utilizes the `Field` class to define the attributes `sample1` and `sample2`, ensuring they are appropriately typed and validated.
- The `field_validator` function is employed to implement custom validation logic that checks whether the two samples are identical. If they are found to be identical, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the samples do not meet the requirements for conducting an independent t-test.
- The class encapsulates the necessary data and validation logic, making it suitable for use in statistical analysis workflows where independent t-tests are required.

### TTestInput

**Description:**
`TTestInput` is a model class designed to represent the input data required for conducting an independent t-test. It ensures that the samples provided for the test are not identical, thereby validating the fundamental assumption of the t-test regarding the independence of the samples.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `TTestInput` class is expected to receive two or more samples as input, which should be distinct from one another. The validation logic within the class ensures that these samples are not identical, adhering to the requirements of an independent t-test.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a structured representation of the input data for the t-test.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `TTestInput` class inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for model instances. This inheritance allows `TTestInput` to utilize common behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`.
- Upon instantiation, the class likely includes validation logic that checks the provided samples to ensure they are not identical. This is crucial for the validity of the t-test, as identical samples would violate the assumption of independence.
- The class may also include methods for further processing or analysis of the samples, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`, making it a self-contained model focused on the requirements of the independent t-test.
