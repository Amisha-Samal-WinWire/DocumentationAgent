# Documentation for `TTestInput`

### TTestInput

**Description:**
`TTestInput` is a model class designed to represent the input data required for conducting an independent t-test. It ensures that the samples provided for the test are not identical, thereby validating the fundamental assumption of the t-test regarding the independence of the samples.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `TTestInput` class is expected to receive two or more samples as input, which should be distinct from one another. The validation logic within the class ensures that these samples are not identical, adhering to the requirements of an independent t-test.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a structured representation of the input data for the t-test.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `TTestInput` class inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for model instances. This inheritance allows `TTestInput` to utilize common behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`.
- Upon instantiation, the class likely includes validation logic that checks the provided samples to ensure they are not identical. This is crucial for the validity of the t-test, as identical samples would violate the assumption of independence.
- The class may also include methods for further processing or analysis of the samples, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`, making it a self-contained model focused on the requirements of the independent t-test.
