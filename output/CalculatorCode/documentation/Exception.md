# Documentation for `Exception`

### Exception

**Description:**
The `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. It is designed to provide a mechanism for error handling in Python programs, allowing developers to raise and catch exceptions as needed. This class is fundamental to the exception handling model in Python, enabling the creation of custom exceptions that can be used to signal specific error conditions in a program.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (as this is a base class).

**Expected Input:**
- The `Exception` class can be instantiated with an optional message string that describes the error. This message can be used to provide additional context about the exception when it is raised.

**Returns:**
None (as this is a class definition).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Exception` class is typically used in conjunction with the `try` and `except` blocks in Python. When an error occurs, an instance of `Exception` (or a subclass thereof) can be raised using the `raise` statement.
- When an exception is raised, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and control is transferred to the nearest enclosing `except` block that can handle the exception.
- The class can be subclassed to create custom exceptions, allowing developers to define specific error types that can be caught and handled separately from standard exceptions.
- The `Exception` class does not have any internal dependencies and is part of the core Python language, making it universally available in any Python environment.
