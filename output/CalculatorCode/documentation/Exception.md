# Documentation for `Exception`

### Exception

**Description:**
The `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. It is used to signal that an error or unexpected condition has occurred during the execution of a program. This class provides a mechanism to handle errors gracefully and allows developers to define custom exceptions that can be raised and caught in their code.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Exception` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, when creating a custom exception, it is common to pass a message string that describes the error.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Exception` class is designed to be subclassed, allowing developers to create their own specific exception types. When an exception is raised, the program flow is interrupted, and control is transferred to the nearest exception handler.
- The class provides a standard interface for accessing the error message and other attributes related to the exception.
- Custom exceptions can be defined by inheriting from the `Exception` class, enabling developers to create meaningful error types that can be caught and handled appropriately in their applications.
- The `Exception` class does not have any internal dependencies, making it a standalone component within the Python exception handling framework.
