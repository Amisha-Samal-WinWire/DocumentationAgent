# Documentation for `Exception`

### Exception

**Description:**
The `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. It is used to signal an error or an unexpected condition that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is raised, it disrupts the normal flow of the program, allowing developers to handle errors gracefully through exception handling mechanisms.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Exception` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, when creating a custom exception, it is common to pass a message string that describes the error.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Exception` class is designed to be subclassed, allowing developers to create their own exception types that can carry additional information or context about the error.
- When an exception is raised, it can be caught using a `try` block followed by an `except` block, allowing the program to continue running or to terminate gracefully.
- The class provides a standard interface for accessing the error message and other attributes, which can be customized in subclasses.
- It does not have any internal dependencies, making it a fundamental part of the Python exception handling framework.
