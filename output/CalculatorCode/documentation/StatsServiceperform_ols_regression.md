### StatsService.perform_ols_regression(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality, without relying on external libraries like statsmodels. It computes the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`np.ndarray`): A 2-D NumPy array representing the independent variables (features) in the regression model. Each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a feature.
- `y` (`np.ndarray`): A 1-D NumPy array representing the dependent variable (target) that is being predicted. It should have the same number of elements as there are rows in `X`.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` must be a 2-D array where each row is an observation and each column is a feature. The number of rows should match the length of `y`.
- `y` must be a 1-D array with a length equal to the number of rows in `X`.
- Both `X` and `y` should contain numeric data types (integers or floats).

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following key-value pairs:
- `coefficients`: The estimated coefficients for each feature in the regression model.
- `intercept`: The estimated intercept of the regression line.
- `r_squared`: The R-squared value indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.
- `p_values`: The p-values associated with each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of the predictors.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by loading the necessary data using the `_load_data` function, ensuring that the most current dataset is available for analysis.
- It then constructs the design matrix by adding a column of ones to `X` to account for the intercept in the regression model.
- The method computes the coefficients using the normal equation for OLS regression, which involves calculating the inverse of the product of the transposed design matrix and the design matrix itself, followed by multiplying it with the transposed design matrix and the dependent variable vector.
- The R-squared value is calculated to assess the goodness of fit of the model, which involves computing the total sum of squares and the residual sum of squares.
- Finally, the method computes the p-values for each coefficient using the t-distribution, which helps to determine the statistical significance of the predictors.
- The results are compiled into a summary dictionary and returned, providing a comprehensive overview of the regression analysis.
