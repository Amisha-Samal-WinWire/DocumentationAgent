### StatsService.perform_ols_regression(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality. It calculates the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the provided input data, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`np.ndarray`): A 2-D NumPy array representing the independent variables (features) in the regression model. Each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a feature.
- `y` (`np.ndarray`): A 1-D NumPy array representing the dependent variable (target) that the model aims to predict.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` should be a 2-D array where the number of rows (observations) is greater than the number of columns (features). All elements should be numerical (integers or floats).
- `y` should be a 1-D array with a length equal to the number of rows in `X`, containing numerical values representing the target variable.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding values:
- `'coefficients'`: A 1-D array of the regression coefficients for each feature.
- `'intercept'`: A float representing the intercept of the regression line.
- `'r_squared'`: A float indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- `'p_values'`: A 1-D array of p-values associated with each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of each feature.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by loading the necessary data using the `_load_data` function, which retrieves the input data for regression analysis.
- It constructs the design matrix by adding a column of ones to `X` to account for the intercept in the regression model.
- The method then calculates the coefficients using the normal equation for OLS regression, which involves matrix operations such as the pseudo-inverse and matrix multiplication.
- It computes the predicted values and the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values).
- The R-squared value is calculated to assess the goodness of fit of the model, indicating how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.
- Finally, the method calculates the p-values for each coefficient to evaluate their statistical significance, using the t-distribution for inference.
- The results are compiled into a summary dictionary and returned to the caller, providing a comprehensive overview of the regression analysis.
