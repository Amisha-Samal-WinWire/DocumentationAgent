### StatsService.perform_ols_regression(X: ndarray, y: ndarray) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` method executes Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality. It computes the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the provided dataset, returning a summary dictionary that encapsulates these statistical metrics.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`ndarray`): A 2-D NumPy array representing the independent variables (predictors) in the regression model. Each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a variable.
- `y` (`ndarray`): A 1-D NumPy array representing the dependent variable (response) that is being predicted by the model.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` should be a 2-D array with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, where `n_samples` is the number of observations and `n_features` is the number of independent variables.
- `y` should be a 1-D array with length `n_samples`, corresponding to the dependent variable values for each observation.
- Both `X` and `y` must contain numerical data (integers or floats) and should not have missing values.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding values:
- `coefficients`: A 1-D array of the estimated coefficients for each independent variable.
- `intercept`: A float representing the estimated intercept of the regression model.
- `r_squared`: A float indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.
- `p_values`: A 1-D array of p-values associated with each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of each predictor.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by loading the necessary data using the `_load_data` function, ensuring that the most current dataset is available for analysis.
- It then constructs the design matrix by adding a column of ones to `X` to account for the intercept in the regression model.
- The method computes the coefficients using the normal equation for OLS regression, which involves matrix operations to minimize the sum of squared residuals.
- The R-squared value is calculated to assess the goodness of fit of the model, indicating how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.
- P-values for each coefficient are computed to evaluate their statistical significance, helping to determine whether the predictors have a meaningful impact on the response variable.
- Finally, the method compiles all computed metrics into a summary dictionary and returns it, providing a comprehensive overview of the regression analysis results.
