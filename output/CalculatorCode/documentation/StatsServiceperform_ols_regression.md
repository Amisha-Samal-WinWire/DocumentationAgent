### StatsService.perform_ols_regression() -> dict

**Description:**
This method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality, without relying on external statistical libraries like statsmodels. It computes the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
The method expects the following data to be loaded internally via `self._load_data`:
- A dataset containing independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) suitable for regression analysis. The independent variables should be in a format that can be processed by NumPy, typically a 2D array or matrix, while the dependent variable should be a 1D array.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A summary dictionary containing the following keys:
- `coefficients`: The estimated coefficients for each independent variable.
- `intercept`: The estimated intercept of the regression line.
- `r_squared`: The coefficient of determination, indicating the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- `p_values`: The p-values associated with each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of the predictors.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **Data Loading**: The method begins by loading the necessary data using `self._load_data`, which retrieves the dataset for analysis.
2. **Matrix Preparation**: It constructs the design matrix `X` by stacking the independent variables and adding a column of ones to account for the intercept.
3. **Coefficient Calculation**: Using NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq`, the method calculates the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals between the observed and predicted values.
4. **Predictions**: The predicted values are computed by multiplying the design matrix `X` with the calculated coefficients.
5. **Residuals and R-squared Calculation**: The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) are computed, and the R-squared value is calculated to assess the model's fit.
6. **Standard Error and P-values**: The method calculates the standard errors of the coefficients and subsequently computes the p-values using the t-distribution from `stats.t.cdf`, which helps in determining the significance of each predictor.
7. **Summary Compilation**: Finally, the method compiles all the computed statistics into a summary dictionary and returns it.

This method provides a straightforward implementation of OLS regression, leveraging NumPy for efficient numerical computations while avoiding the complexity of additional statistical libraries.

### StatsService.perform_ols_regression(X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality. It calculates the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the provided input data, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`np.ndarray`): A 2-D NumPy array representing the independent variables (features) in the regression model. Each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a feature.
- `y` (`np.ndarray`): A 1-D NumPy array representing the dependent variable (target) that the model aims to predict.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` should be a 2-D array where the number of rows (observations) is greater than the number of columns (features). All elements should be numerical (integers or floats).
- `y` should be a 1-D array with a length equal to the number of rows in `X`, containing numerical values representing the target variable.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding values:
- `'coefficients'`: A 1-D array of the regression coefficients for each feature.
- `'intercept'`: A float representing the intercept of the regression line.
- `'r_squared'`: A float indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- `'p_values'`: A 1-D array of p-values associated with each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of each feature.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by loading the necessary data using the `_load_data` function, which retrieves the input data for regression analysis.
- It constructs the design matrix by adding a column of ones to `X` to account for the intercept in the regression model.
- The method then calculates the coefficients using the normal equation for OLS regression, which involves matrix operations such as the pseudo-inverse and matrix multiplication.
- It computes the predicted values and the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values).
- The R-squared value is calculated to assess the goodness of fit of the model, indicating how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.
- Finally, the method calculates the p-values for each coefficient to evaluate their statistical significance, using the t-distribution for inference.
- The results are compiled into a summary dictionary and returned to the caller, providing a comprehensive overview of the regression analysis.
