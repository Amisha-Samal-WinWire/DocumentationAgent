# Documentation for `Field`

### Field

**Description:**
The `Field` class represents a data structure that encapsulates a specific field within a larger context, such as a form or a database schema. It is designed to manage the properties and behaviors associated with that field, including validation, default values, and metadata.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `name` (`str`): The name of the field, which serves as an identifier.
- `type` (`str`): The data type of the field (e.g., "string", "integer", "boolean"), indicating what kind of data it can hold.
- `required` (`bool`): A flag indicating whether the field is mandatory or optional. Defaults to `False`.
- `default` (`Any`): The default value for the field if no value is provided. Can be of any type, depending on the field's type.
- `validators` (`List[Callable]`): A list of validation functions that can be applied to the field's value to ensure it meets certain criteria.

**Expected Input:**
- The `name` parameter should be a non-empty string.
- The `type` parameter should be a valid data type string that corresponds to the expected data (e.g., "string", "integer").
- The `required` parameter should be a boolean value.
- The `default` parameter can be any type but should be compatible with the specified `type`.
- The `validators` parameter should be a list of callable functions that accept a single argument (the field value) and return a boolean indicating validity.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation but initializes an object representing a field.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `Field` class initializes its attributes based on the provided parameters.
- It validates the `name` and `type` to ensure they conform to expected formats.
- If the `required` attribute is set to `True`, the class ensures that any value assigned to the field must not be `None`.
- The `default` value is assigned if no value is provided during field assignment.
- The `validators` are stored and can be invoked later to check the validity of the field's value when it is set or modified.
- This class does not have any external dependencies and operates solely on its internal logic and attributes.
