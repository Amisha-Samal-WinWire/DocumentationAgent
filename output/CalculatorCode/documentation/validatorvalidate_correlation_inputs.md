# Documentation for `validator.validate_correlation_inputs`

### validator.validate_correlation_inputs

**Description:**
The `validate_correlation_inputs` function is designed to ensure that the inputs provided for correlation analysis are valid and meet specific criteria. This function checks the integrity and compatibility of the input data, which is crucial for accurate statistical analysis and interpretation of correlation results.

**Parameters:**
- `data1` (`list` or `array-like`): The first dataset to be analyzed for correlation. This should be a one-dimensional collection of numerical values.
- `data2` (`list` or `array-like`): The second dataset to be analyzed for correlation. This should also be a one-dimensional collection of numerical values.
- `method` (`str`, optional): The method of correlation to be used, such as 'pearson', 'kendall', or 'spearman'. Defaults to 'pearson'. This parameter determines the statistical technique applied during the correlation calculation.

**Expected Input:**
- `data1` and `data2` must be of the same length and contain numerical values. They should not be empty.
- The `method` parameter should be a string that matches one of the accepted correlation methods. If an unsupported method is provided, the function should raise an error.

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the inputs are valid for correlation analysis; otherwise, it raises an exception indicating the nature of the validation failure.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if both `data1` and `data2` are non-empty and of equal length. If either condition fails, it raises a `ValueError`.
- It then verifies that all elements in both datasets are numeric. If any non-numeric values are found, it raises a `TypeError`.
- If the `method` parameter is provided, the function checks if it matches one of the predefined correlation methods. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
- Finally, if all checks pass, the function returns `True`, indicating that the inputs are valid for correlation analysis. This validation process ensures that subsequent correlation calculations can be performed without errors.
