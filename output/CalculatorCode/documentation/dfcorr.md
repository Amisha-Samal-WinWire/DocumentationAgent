# Documentation for `df.corr`

### df.corr()

**Description:**
Calculates the pairwise correlation of columns in a DataFrame, excluding NA/null values. This function is commonly used in data analysis to understand the relationships between different variables in a dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `method` (`str`, optional): The method to compute the correlation. Options include:
  - `'pearson'`: Standard correlation coefficient.
  - `'kendall'`: Kendall Tau correlation coefficient.
  - `'spearman'`: Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
  
  Default is `'pearson'`.

- `min_periods` (`int`, optional): Minimum number of observations required per pair of columns to have a valid result. If the number of non-null observations is less than this value, the result will be `NaN`. Default is `1`.

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a DataFrame object with numerical columns. It can handle missing values (NA/null) by excluding them from the correlation calculations.
- The `method` parameter should be a string that matches one of the accepted correlation methods.
- The `min_periods` parameter should be a positive integer.

**Returns:**
`DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the correlation coefficients between the columns of the input DataFrame. The index and columns of the returned DataFrame will correspond to the original DataFrame's columns.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters, ensuring that the specified `method` is one of the accepted correlation types and that `min_periods` is a positive integer.
- It then computes the correlation matrix by iterating over the pairs of columns in the DataFrame.
- For each pair, it calculates the correlation coefficient using the specified method, taking care to exclude any NA/null values.
- The results are compiled into a new DataFrame, which is returned to the user.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and operates solely on the DataFrame's internal data structures.
