# Documentation for `df.corr`

### df.corr()

**Description:**
The `df.corr` function computes the pairwise correlation coefficients between the columns of a DataFrame. This function is essential for understanding the relationships between different variables in a dataset, allowing users to identify patterns and correlations that may exist.

**Parameters:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The function operates on a DataFrame object, which is expected to contain numerical data. Non-numeric columns will be ignored in the correlation calculation.
- The DataFrame should ideally have a sufficient number of rows to produce meaningful correlation results; otherwise, the output may be less reliable.

**Returns:**
`DataFrame`: A new DataFrame containing the correlation coefficients between each pair of columns. The values range from -1 to 1, where:
- `1` indicates a perfect positive correlation,
- `-1` indicates a perfect negative correlation,
- `0` indicates no correlation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function iterates through the columns of the DataFrame and computes the correlation coefficient for each pair of columns using a statistical method (typically Pearson's correlation).
- It constructs a square matrix where the rows and columns correspond to the original DataFrame's columns, and each cell contains the correlation coefficient for the respective column pair.
- The resulting correlation matrix is returned as a new DataFrame, allowing for easy interpretation and further analysis.
- The function does not rely on any external dependencies, making it a straightforward utility for statistical analysis within the DataFrame context.
