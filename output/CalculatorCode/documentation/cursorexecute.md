# Documentation for `cursor.execute`

### cursor.execute(query: str, params: Optional[dict] = None) -> None

**Description:**
The `cursor.execute` function is responsible for executing a database query against a connected database. It allows for both parameterized queries and direct SQL command execution, facilitating interaction with the database to perform operations such as data retrieval, insertion, updating, or deletion.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): A string representing the SQL query to be executed. This can include placeholders for parameters if a parameterized query is being used.
- `params` (`Optional[dict]`): An optional dictionary containing parameters to be substituted into the query. This is used to safely pass values into the SQL command, preventing SQL injection attacks.

**Expected Input:**
- The `query` parameter must be a valid SQL command as a string. It can be any SQL statement supported by the database, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
- The `params` parameter, if provided, should be a dictionary where keys correspond to the placeholders in the SQL query. The values should be of types compatible with the database (e.g., strings, integers, dates).

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value. Instead, it directly affects the state of the database by executing the provided query.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by preparing the SQL query for execution. If parameters are provided, it ensures that they are correctly bound to the placeholders in the query.
- It then sends the prepared query to the database engine for execution. This involves communicating with the database server, which processes the query and performs the requested operation.
- After execution, the function may handle any exceptions that arise, such as syntax errors in the SQL command or issues with database connectivity.
- The function does not return results directly; instead, it may affect the state of the database (e.g., modifying records or returning a cursor for result sets in the case of SELECT queries).
- This function is typically part of a larger database interaction framework, and its behavior may depend on the specific database driver being used.
