# Documentation for `cursor.execute`

### cursor.execute(query: str, parameters: Optional[tuple] = None) -> None

**Description:**
The `cursor.execute` function is responsible for executing a database query against a connected database. It allows users to run SQL commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE, and is a fundamental operation in database interaction.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): A string containing the SQL command to be executed. This can include placeholders for parameters.
- `parameters` (`Optional[tuple]`): An optional tuple containing the values to be substituted into the query's placeholders. If the query does not require parameters, this can be omitted or set to `None`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `query` parameter should be a well-formed SQL statement. It must adhere to the syntax rules of the specific SQL dialect being used by the database.
- The `parameters` should be a tuple of values that correspond to the placeholders in the SQL query. The number and type of parameters must match the placeholders defined in the query.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return any value. Instead, it performs the action specified by the SQL command, which may affect the database state or retrieve data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by preparing the SQL command for execution, ensuring that it is properly formatted and safe from SQL injection attacks.
- If parameters are provided, the function binds these values to the corresponding placeholders in the SQL command.
- The function then sends the command to the database for execution. This involves communicating with the database engine, which processes the command and performs the requested operation.
- Depending on the type of SQL command executed, the function may affect the database state (e.g., modifying records) or prepare results for retrieval (e.g., fetching rows from a SELECT statement).
- Error handling is typically implemented to manage any exceptions that arise during the execution, such as syntax errors in the SQL command or connection issues with the database.
