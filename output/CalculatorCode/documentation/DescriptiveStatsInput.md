# Documentation for `DescriptiveStatsInput`

### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
`DescriptiveStatsInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of descriptive statistics. It serves as a structured input container that encapsulates the necessary data and parameters required for performing statistical analyses, ensuring that the data is organized and accessible for further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class is expected to handle a collection of data points, typically represented as a list. This collection can include various data types, such as integers or floats, that are relevant for statistical calculations.
- The class may also be designed to accept additional parameters or configurations that dictate how the descriptive statistics should be computed, although specific details are not provided in the current context.

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return any values upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `DescriptiveStatsInput` inherits from the `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the foundational functionalities provided by `BaseModel`, such as shared methods and properties that can be utilized or overridden.
- The class is likely structured to include methods for validating the input data, ensuring that it meets the necessary criteria for statistical analysis.
- It may also include methods for calculating various descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, although these functionalities are not explicitly detailed in the provided context.
- The design promotes a clean and organized approach to managing input data for descriptive statistics, allowing for easy integration with other components of the application that require statistical analysis capabilities.
