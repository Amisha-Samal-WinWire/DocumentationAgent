### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class serves as a model for calculating descriptive statistics. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to perform statistical analysis on a given dataset, providing a structured way to manage input data for such calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values representing the dataset for which descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list of floating-point numbers. It is expected that the list contains valid numerical entries, and it should not be empty, as descriptive statistics require a dataset to compute meaningful results.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes an object that can be used to perform further calculations related to descriptive statistics.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model representation, such as validation and serialization.
- Upon creation of an instance of `DescriptiveStatsInput`, the provided dataset is stored in the `data` attribute.
- The class is designed to facilitate the calculation of various descriptive statistics (such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation) by providing a structured way to manage and validate the input data.
- The interaction with `BaseModel` may include methods for data validation and ensuring that the input adheres to expected formats and types, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.

### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
`DescriptiveStatsInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of descriptive statistics. It serves as a structured input representation for statistical computations, ensuring that the necessary data is organized and accessible for analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class is expected to be instantiated with data that conforms to the requirements of descriptive statistics calculations. This may include numerical datasets or collections of values that can be analyzed to derive statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `DescriptiveStatsInput` inherits the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`, which may include methods for data validation and serialization.
- The class is intended to encapsulate the input data necessary for performing descriptive statistics, ensuring that the data is structured in a way that is compatible with the statistical analysis processes.
- The logic within `DescriptiveStatsInput` likely involves preparing the input data for further processing, which may include validation checks to ensure that the data is suitable for statistical calculations.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies beyond those provided by `BaseModel`, promoting modularity and reusability within the codebase.
