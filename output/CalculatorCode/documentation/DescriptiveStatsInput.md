# Documentation for `DescriptiveStatsInput`

### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
`DescriptiveStatsInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of descriptive statistics. It serves as a structured input representation for statistical computations, ensuring that the necessary data is organized and accessible for analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class is expected to be instantiated with data that conforms to the requirements of descriptive statistics calculations. This may include numerical datasets or collections of values that can be analyzed to derive statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `DescriptiveStatsInput` inherits the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`, which may include methods for data validation and serialization.
- The class is intended to encapsulate the input data necessary for performing descriptive statistics, ensuring that the data is structured in a way that is compatible with the statistical analysis processes.
- The logic within `DescriptiveStatsInput` likely involves preparing the input data for further processing, which may include validation checks to ensure that the data is suitable for statistical calculations.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies beyond those provided by `BaseModel`, promoting modularity and reusability within the codebase.
