# Documentation for `DescriptiveStatsInput`

### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
`DescriptiveStatsInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of descriptive statistics. It serves as a structured input container that inherits from the `BaseModel`, allowing it to leverage shared functionality while encapsulating specific attributes and methods relevant to descriptive statistical analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class is expected to be instantiated without any specific parameters, as it inherits from `BaseModel` which does not define any constructor parameters. Any attributes or parameters necessary for descriptive statistics calculations should be defined within this class.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `DescriptiveStatsInput` inherits the foundational structure and behavior provided by `BaseModel`, which is intended for code reuse and consistency.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the input data required for calculating descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
- While the specific attributes and methods for handling descriptive statistics are not detailed in the provided information, it is implied that this class will include mechanisms to store and manipulate the relevant statistical data.
- The class does not implement any specific logic on its own but is expected to define its own attributes and methods to fulfill its role in the overall application, potentially interacting with other components responsible for statistical calculations.
