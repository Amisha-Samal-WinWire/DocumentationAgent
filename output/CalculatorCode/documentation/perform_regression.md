# Documentation for `perform_regression`

### perform_regression(X: array-like, y: array-like) -> RegressionResults

**Description:**
The `perform_regression` function is responsible for executing a regression analysis on the provided datasets. It validates the input data, ensuring that it meets the necessary criteria for regression modeling, and then performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using the validated inputs. This function serves as an endpoint for clients to submit data for statistical analysis, returning the results of the regression.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`array-like`): The independent variable(s) input data, typically a 2D array or DataFrame containing the features used for prediction.
- `y` (`array-like`): The dependent variable output data, usually a 1D array or Series representing the target values that the model aims to predict.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` should be a 2D array-like structure (e.g., list of lists, NumPy array, or DataFrame) where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature.
- `y` should be a 1D array-like structure (e.g., list, NumPy array, or Series) containing numeric values corresponding to the observations in `X`.
- The shapes of `X` and `y` must be compatible, meaning the number of rows in `X` must equal the number of elements in `y`.
- Both `X` and `y` must contain numeric data types (e.g., integers or floats).

**Returns:**
`RegressionResults`: An object containing the results of the OLS regression analysis, including coefficients, statistical significance, and goodness-of-fit metrics.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the inputs using the `validator.validate_regression_inputs` function, which checks the integrity and appropriateness of the data.
- If the inputs are valid, it proceeds to call the `stats_svc.perform_ols_regression` function, passing the validated independent and dependent variables along with the dataset.
- The OLS regression analysis is performed, calculating the regression coefficients and other statistical measures.
- Finally, the function returns the results of the regression analysis, which can be used for further interpretation or reporting.
- If any validation errors occur during the input checks, appropriate exceptions are raised, ensuring that clients receive clear feedback on the nature of the input issues.
