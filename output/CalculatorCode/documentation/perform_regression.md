# Documentation for `perform_regression`

### perform_regression() -> None

**Description:**
The `perform_regression` function is an endpoint handler designed to facilitate the execution of regression analysis within a web application. It processes incoming POST requests containing data for regression analysis, performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using the provided dataset, and returns the results in a structured format. This function serves as a bridge between client requests and the underlying statistical analysis performed by the `stats_svc.perform_ols_regression` function.

**Parameters:**
- `None`: The function does not take any parameters directly, as it is designed to handle HTTP requests through the web framework.

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects the incoming POST request to contain a JSON payload that includes the necessary data for performing regression analysis. This typically includes:
  - A dependent variable (the outcome variable).
  - One or more independent variables (predictors).
- The data should be structured in a way that is compatible with the OLS regression requirements, such as being formatted as a DataFrame or a similar data structure.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return a value directly. Instead, it sends a response back to the client containing the results of the regression analysis, which may include regression coefficients and statistical metrics.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the incoming request to ensure it contains the required data for regression analysis.
- It extracts the relevant data from the request payload and prepares it for processing.
- The function then calls the `stats_svc.perform_ols_regression` function to execute the OLS regression analysis on the provided dataset.
- After the regression analysis is complete, it formats the results into a JSON response, which includes the regression coefficients and other statistical metrics.
- Finally, the function sends the response back to the client, allowing them to access the results of the regression analysis. 

This function is crucial for enabling users to perform statistical analysis through a web interface, leveraging the capabilities of the underlying regression analysis service.
