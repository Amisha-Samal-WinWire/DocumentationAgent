# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix`

### calculate_correlation_matrix() -> ndarray

**Description:**
Calculates the correlation matrix for a given dataset, which quantifies the degree to which different variables in the dataset are related to one another. The correlation matrix is a key statistical tool used in data analysis to understand relationships between variables.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically in the form of a two-dimensional array or DataFrame, where rows represent observations and columns represent variables. The dataset should contain numerical values, as the correlation calculation requires quantitative data.
- It is important that the dataset does not contain missing values, as these can lead to inaccurate correlation results.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables in the dataset. Each element in the matrix indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, with values ranging from -1 to 1.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it is in the correct format and free of missing values.
- It then computes the correlation coefficients using a statistical method, typically Pearson's correlation, which measures the linear relationship between pairs of variables.
- The resulting correlation coefficients are organized into a matrix format, where each cell (i, j) contains the correlation coefficient between variable i and variable j.
- Finally, the function returns the correlation matrix, which can be used for further analysis or visualization in data science applications. 

This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided dataset.
