# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix`

### calculate_correlation_matrix() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**
Calculates the correlation matrix for a given dataset, which quantifies the degree to which different variables in the dataset are linearly related. The correlation matrix is a crucial statistical tool used in data analysis to identify relationships between variables.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset in the form of a two-dimensional array or DataFrame where rows represent observations and columns represent variables. Each column should contain numerical data.
- The dataset should not contain any missing values, as this may lead to inaccurate correlation calculations.

**Returns:**
`np.ndarray`: A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the correlation matrix, where each element (i, j) indicates the correlation coefficient between variable i and variable j. The values range from -1 to 1, where:
- 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation,
- -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation,
- 0 indicates no correlation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it is in the correct format and does not contain missing values.
- It then computes the correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables using a statistical method, typically Pearson's correlation.
- The resulting correlation coefficients are organized into a square matrix format, where the dimensions correspond to the number of variables in the dataset.
- Finally, the function returns the correlation matrix, which can be used for further analysis or visualization. This function does not rely on any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility for correlation analysis.
