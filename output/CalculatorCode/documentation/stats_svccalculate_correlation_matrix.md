# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix`

### calculate_correlation_matrix() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**
Calculates the correlation matrix for a given dataset, which quantifies the degree to which different variables in the dataset are related to one another. The correlation matrix is a key statistical tool used to understand relationships between multiple variables, aiding in data analysis and interpretation.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset in the form of a two-dimensional array or DataFrame, where each column represents a different variable and each row represents an observation. The dataset should contain numerical values, and it is advisable to handle missing values appropriately before calling this function.

**Returns:**
`np.ndarray`: A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the correlation coefficients between the variables in the dataset. Each element in the matrix indicates the correlation between a pair of variables, ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it is in the correct format and contains the necessary numerical data.
- It then computes the correlation coefficients using a statistical method, typically Pearson's correlation, which measures the linear relationship between pairs of variables.
- The resulting correlation coefficients are organized into a square matrix format, where the dimensions correspond to the number of variables in the dataset.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided dataset, leveraging NumPy for efficient numerical computations.
