# Documentation for `DataService`

### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class is designed to facilitate the loading of data into Pandas DataFrames from various sources, including files (such as CSV) and databases (specifically SQLite). It abstracts the complexities involved in data retrieval and conversion, providing a streamlined interface for users to access and manipulate data efficiently.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `data_source` (`str`): The type of data source being accessed (e.g., 'csv', 'sqlite').
- `query` (`str`, optional): A SQL query string used to specify the data to be retrieved from the SQLite database.
- `file_path` (`str`, optional): The path to the CSV file when loading data from a CSV source.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` must be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `data_source` should be a string indicating the type of data source (e.g., 'csv' or 'sqlite').
- If `data_source` is 'sqlite', `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement.
- If `data_source` is 'csv', `file_path` should point to a valid CSV file.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the loaded data. If the data source is a CSV file, the DataFrame will be populated with the contents of the file. If the data source is a SQLite database, the DataFrame will contain the results of the executed SQL query.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The class initializes by accepting parameters that define the data source and its location.
- Depending on the specified `data_source`, it either reads data from a CSV file using `pd.read_csv` or retrieves data from a SQLite database using a SQL query executed through `pd.read_sql_query`.
- For CSV files, it validates the `file_path` to ensure it points to a readable file and then loads the data into a DataFrame.
- For SQLite databases, it establishes a connection using `sqlite3.connect`, executes the provided SQL query, and converts the results into a DataFrame.
- The class handles potential errors related to data loading, such as file not found or SQL execution errors, by raising a `DataError` exception when issues arise.
- Finally, the loaded DataFrame is returned, allowing users to perform further data manipulation and analysis using the powerful features of the Pandas library.
