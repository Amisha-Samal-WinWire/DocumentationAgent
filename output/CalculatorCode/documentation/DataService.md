### DataService

**Description:**  
The `DataService` class serves as a utility for loading data into pandas objects from various sources, including files and databases. It provides methods to read data from CSV files and SQLite databases, facilitating data manipulation and analysis within the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**  
None (the class does not have any attributes defined in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**  
- The methods within the `DataService` class expect valid file paths for CSV files and established SQLite database connections. 
- For methods that retrieve data from a CSV file, the `file_path` must point to an accessible CSV file, and the `column_name` must correspond to an existing column header in that file.
- For methods that interact with a SQLite database, the `table_name` and `column_name` must match existing entities in the database.

**Returns:**  
- The methods return pandas objects: either a `pandas.DataFrame` or a `pd.Series`, depending on the method invoked. 
- If the specified data cannot be retrieved due to issues such as non-existent files, columns, or tables, a `DataError` may be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `DataService` class includes several key methods:
  - `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`: This method connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table, returning it as a pandas DataFrame. It executes a SQL query to select all records from a predefined table and handles any connection or retrieval errors by raising a `DataError`.
  
  - `get_series_from_file`: This method reads a CSV file from a specified path, extracts data from a designated column, and returns it as a pandas Series. It checks for the existence of the specified column and raises a `DataError` if the column is not found or if the file is improperly formatted.
  
  - `get_series_from_sqlite`: This method retrieves data from a specified column in a SQLite database table and returns it as a pandas Series. It constructs a SQL query to select all entries from the specified column and raises a `DataError` if the column or table does not exist.

- Each method is designed to handle typical data integrity issues and relies on the pandas library for efficient data manipulation. The class is structured to provide a seamless interface for data retrieval, ensuring that users can easily access and work with data stored in various formats.
