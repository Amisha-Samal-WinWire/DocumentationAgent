### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class is designed to facilitate the loading of data into pandas DataFrames from various sources, including files and databases. It provides methods to read data efficiently, ensuring that the data is accessible for further analysis and processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
The class does not have specific input parameters as it is a service class. However, its methods expect specific types of input:
- For database-related methods, a valid database path (string) and a table name (string) are required.
- For file-related methods, a valid file path (string) and the appropriate file format (e.g., CSV) must be provided.

**Returns:**
The methods of the `DataService` class typically return a `pandas.DataFrame` object, which represents the loaded data. If the data source is invalid or the data cannot be loaded, appropriate exceptions are raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataService` class utilizes several external libraries, including `os`, `sqlite3`, and `pandas`, to perform its operations.
- It checks the existence of files or databases using `os.path.exists` to ensure that the specified paths are valid before attempting to load data.
- For database interactions, it establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`, executes SQL queries to retrieve data, and loads the results into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_sql_query`.
- The class includes error handling to manage scenarios where the database file does not exist, the specified table is empty, or other database-related errors occur, raising a custom `DataError` exception with informative messages.
- The methods are designed to be reusable, allowing other services (like `ValidationService` and `StatsService`) to leverage the data loading capabilities provided by the `DataService` class.

### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class is designed to facilitate the loading of data into Pandas DataFrames from various sources, including files (such as CSV) and databases (specifically SQLite). It provides methods to read data efficiently and handle potential data integrity issues through custom error handling.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `data_source` (`str`): The source type from which data will be loaded (e.g., 'csv', 'sqlite').
- `query` (`str`, optional): The SQL query string to be executed against the SQLite database when loading data from it.
- `csv_file_path` (`str`, optional): The file path to the CSV file when loading data from a CSV source.

**Expected Input:**
- `database_path` must be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `data_source` should be a string indicating the type of data source (e.g., 'csv' or 'sqlite').
- If `data_source` is 'sqlite', `query` must be a valid SQL SELECT statement.
- If `data_source` is 'csv', `csv_file_path` must point to a valid CSV file.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the data loaded from the specified source. If the source is invalid or no data is found, an empty DataFrame may be returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The class initializes by accepting parameters that define the data source and connection details.
- Depending on the `data_source`, it either reads data from a CSV file using `pd.read_csv` or executes a SQL query against a SQLite database using `pd.read_sql_query`.
- For CSV files, it validates the file path and uses the Pandas library to load the data into a DataFrame.
- For SQLite databases, it establishes a connection using `sqlite3.connect`, executes the provided SQL query, and retrieves the results as a DataFrame.
- The class includes error handling mechanisms, specifically raising a `DataError` when issues related to data integrity or loading occur, ensuring that users are informed of any problems during the data loading process.
- The overall design emphasizes flexibility and robustness, allowing users to seamlessly integrate data from various sources into their data analysis workflows.
