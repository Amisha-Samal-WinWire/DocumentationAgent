# Documentation for `DataService`

### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class is designed to facilitate the loading of data into Pandas DataFrames from various sources, including files (such as CSV) and databases (specifically SQLite). It provides methods to read data efficiently and handle potential data integrity issues through custom error handling.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `data_source` (`str`): The source type from which data will be loaded (e.g., 'csv', 'sqlite').
- `query` (`str`, optional): The SQL query string to be executed against the SQLite database when loading data from it.
- `csv_file_path` (`str`, optional): The file path to the CSV file when loading data from a CSV source.

**Expected Input:**
- `database_path` must be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `data_source` should be a string indicating the type of data source (e.g., 'csv' or 'sqlite').
- If `data_source` is 'sqlite', `query` must be a valid SQL SELECT statement.
- If `data_source` is 'csv', `csv_file_path` must point to a valid CSV file.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the data loaded from the specified source. If the source is invalid or no data is found, an empty DataFrame may be returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The class initializes by accepting parameters that define the data source and connection details.
- Depending on the `data_source`, it either reads data from a CSV file using `pd.read_csv` or executes a SQL query against a SQLite database using `pd.read_sql_query`.
- For CSV files, it validates the file path and uses the Pandas library to load the data into a DataFrame.
- For SQLite databases, it establishes a connection using `sqlite3.connect`, executes the provided SQL query, and retrieves the results as a DataFrame.
- The class includes error handling mechanisms, specifically raising a `DataError` when issues related to data integrity or loading occur, ensuring that users are informed of any problems during the data loading process.
- The overall design emphasizes flexibility and robustness, allowing users to seamlessly integrate data from various sources into their data analysis workflows.
