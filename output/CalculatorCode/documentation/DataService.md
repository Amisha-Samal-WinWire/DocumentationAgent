# Documentation for `DataService`

### DataService

**Description:**
`DataService` is a service class designed to facilitate the loading of data into Pandas DataFrames from various sources, including CSV files and SQLite databases. It abstracts the complexities of data retrieval, allowing users to easily access and manipulate data in a structured format suitable for analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None** (This class does not have parameters or attributes explicitly documented in the provided information.)

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to interact with valid file paths for CSV files and valid SQLite database paths. It should handle various data formats and ensure that the data is correctly loaded into Pandas DataFrames for further processing.

**Returns:**
- **None** (The class itself does not return values but provides methods that return Pandas DataFrames.)

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataService` class utilizes several dependencies to perform its tasks:
  - It employs `sqlite3.connect` to establish connections to SQLite databases, enabling SQL query execution and data retrieval.
  - It uses `pd.read_sql_query` to execute SQL queries and convert the results into Pandas DataFrames, facilitating seamless data manipulation.
  - The class also leverages `pd.read_csv` to read data from CSV files into DataFrames, providing flexibility in data sourcing.
  - Additionally, it may utilize `StringIO` for handling in-memory string data, particularly useful for temporary data processing tasks.
  
- The class likely contains methods that encapsulate the logic for loading data from different sources, managing connections, executing queries, and returning the results as DataFrames. Each method is expected to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that users receive informative feedback in case of issues during data loading.

- Overall, `DataService` serves as a central hub for data loading operations, streamlining the process of integrating data from various formats into the Pandas ecosystem for analysis and manipulation.
