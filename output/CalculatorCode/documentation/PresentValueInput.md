# Documentation for `PresentValueInput`

### PresentValueInput

**Description:**
`PresentValueInput` is a class that extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, specifically designed to handle the input parameters required for calculating the present value in financial calculations. It encapsulates the necessary fields and validation logic to ensure that the input data is correctly formatted and meets the required criteria for further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `PresentValueInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes in the provided context. It inherits attributes and methods from the `BaseModel` class.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to manage input data related to present value calculations. While specific input fields are not detailed in the provided context, it typically includes parameters such as the future value, interest rate, and time period, which are essential for present value computations.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; it creates an object that represents the input data for present value calculations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `PresentValueInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it can utilize any shared methods and properties defined in the base class. This allows it to maintain a consistent interface and leverage common functionalities such as validation and serialization.
- The class is likely designed to include specific fields for present value calculations, which may involve validation rules to ensure that the input data is accurate and complete.
- It may also implement methods for data manipulation, such as formatting the input values or converting them into a suitable format for calculations.
- The class operates independently but relies on the foundational logic provided by `BaseModel`, ensuring that it adheres to the overall structure and design principles of the application.
