# Documentation for `PresentValueInput`

### PresentValueInput

**Description:**
`PresentValueInput` is a class that extends the functionality of `BaseModel` to represent the input parameters required for calculating the present value in financial calculations. It encapsulates the necessary fields and validation logic to ensure that the input data adheres to the expected format and constraints.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `fields` (`List[Field]`): A list of `Field` instances that define the attributes of the present value input, including their names, types, and validation rules.

**Expected Input:**
- The `fields` attribute should contain a list of `Field` objects, each representing a specific input parameter required for the present value calculation. Each `Field` should have a valid `name`, `type`, and may include additional properties such as `required`, `default`, and `validators`.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation but initializes an object that represents the input parameters for present value calculations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `PresentValueInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, gaining access to its foundational properties and methods.
- The class initializes its `fields` attribute, which is populated with `Field` instances that define the necessary input parameters for present value calculations.
- Each `Field` is configured with specific attributes such as `name`, `type`, and validation rules, ensuring that the input data is correctly structured and validated.
- The class does not implement any specific methods beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`, relying on the `Field` class to manage the validation and behavior of its input parameters.
- This design promotes a clear separation of concerns, allowing `PresentValueInput` to focus on defining the structure of the input while delegating validation logic to the `Field` instances.
