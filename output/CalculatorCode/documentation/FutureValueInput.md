### FutureValueInput

**Description:**
The `FutureValueInput` class serves as a model for calculating the future value of an investment or cash flow. It is responsible for validating cash flow conventions, ensuring that the input data adheres to the expected formats and constraints necessary for accurate future value calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not take any parameters upon instantiation. Instead, it defines attributes that are validated internally.

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects attributes related to cash flow, such as amounts and time periods, to be set after instantiation. These attributes must conform to specific validation rules defined within the class to ensure they are appropriate for future value calculations.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it provides methods to retrieve validated attributes and perform calculations based on those attributes.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FutureValueInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model validation and data handling.
- It utilizes the `Field` class to define its attributes, which may include properties like cash flow amounts and time periods.
- The class employs the `field_validator` to enforce validation rules on its attributes, ensuring that inputs meet specific criteria (e.g., non-negative values for cash flows).
- If any validation fails, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating the nature of the input error.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic required for future value calculations, allowing for easy integration with other components of the application that require future value computations.

### FutureValueInput

**Description:**
The `FutureValueInput` class is designed to model the inputs required for calculating the future value of an investment or cash flow. It incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure that the cash flow conventions adhere to specified rules, thereby maintaining data integrity and correctness in financial calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context. It inherits from `BaseModel`, which may provide common attributes and methods.

**Expected Input:**
- The `FutureValueInput` class is expected to receive input data that represents cash flows and their conventions. The specific structure and types of these inputs are not detailed in the provided context but are likely validated against financial standards.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a model for future value calculations, encapsulating the necessary data and validation logic.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FutureValueInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational structure and behaviors. This inheritance allows `FutureValueInput` to utilize common methods for data handling and validation.
- The class likely employs the `field_validator` function to validate input fields based on predefined criteria, ensuring that cash flow data meets necessary requirements (e.g., type checks, presence checks).
- It may also include methods for processing the validated data to compute future values, although these methods are not explicitly detailed in the provided context.
- The class is designed to ensure that any cash flow conventions used in future value calculations are correctly formatted and validated, thereby preventing errors in financial computations. 

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `FutureValueInput` class, outlining its purpose, expected behavior, and interaction with its dependencies.
