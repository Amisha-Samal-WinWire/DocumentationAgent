# Documentation for `FutureValueInput`

### FutureValueInput

**Description:**
`FutureValueInput` is a class that extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, specifically designed to represent and manage the input parameters required for calculating the future value of an investment. This class encapsulates the necessary attributes and validation logic to ensure that the input data is correctly formatted and meets the required criteria for future value calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `FutureValueInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle input data related to future value calculations, which may include parameters such as principal amount, interest rate, and time period. The specific constraints or formats for these inputs are not detailed in the provided context but are typically numeric and should adhere to financial calculation standards.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; it creates an object that represents the future value input parameters.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `FutureValueInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it can utilize any shared methods or properties defined in `BaseModel`, such as validation or serialization methods.
- The class likely includes validation logic to ensure that the input values for future value calculations are valid, such as checking for non-negative values for principal and interest rates.
- It may also implement methods to format the input data appropriately for further calculations or to prepare it for output in a user-friendly manner.
- The class operates independently, relying on its own logic and the inherited functionality from `BaseModel` to manage the future value input effectively within the broader application context.
