# Documentation for `FutureValueInput`

### FutureValueInput

**Description:**
The `FutureValueInput` class is designed to model the inputs required for calculating the future value of an investment or cash flow. It incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure that the cash flow conventions adhere to specified rules, thereby maintaining data integrity and correctness in financial calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context. It inherits from `BaseModel`, which may provide common attributes and methods.

**Expected Input:**
- The `FutureValueInput` class is expected to receive input data that represents cash flows and their conventions. The specific structure and types of these inputs are not detailed in the provided context but are likely validated against financial standards.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a model for future value calculations, encapsulating the necessary data and validation logic.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FutureValueInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational structure and behaviors. This inheritance allows `FutureValueInput` to utilize common methods for data handling and validation.
- The class likely employs the `field_validator` function to validate input fields based on predefined criteria, ensuring that cash flow data meets necessary requirements (e.g., type checks, presence checks).
- It may also include methods for processing the validated data to compute future values, although these methods are not explicitly detailed in the provided context.
- The class is designed to ensure that any cash flow conventions used in future value calculations are correctly formatted and validated, thereby preventing errors in financial computations. 

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `FutureValueInput` class, outlining its purpose, expected behavior, and interaction with its dependencies.
