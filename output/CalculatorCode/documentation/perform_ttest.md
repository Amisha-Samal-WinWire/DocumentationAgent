# Documentation for `perform_ttest`

### perform_ttest(data1: list, data2: list, equal_var: bool = True)

**Description:**
The `perform_ttest` function is designed to facilitate the execution of an independent two-sample t-test, which assesses whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent datasets. This function serves as an endpoint in a web API, allowing clients to submit data for statistical analysis and receive the results in a structured format.

**Parameters:**
- `data1` (`list`): The first dataset, which is a collection of numerical values representing one group.
- `data2` (`list`): The second dataset, which is a collection of numerical values representing another group.
- `equal_var` (`bool`, optional): A flag indicating whether to assume equal population variances. Defaults to `True`. If set to `False`, the function will utilize Welch's t-test, which is appropriate for datasets with unequal variances.

**Expected Input:**
- `data1` and `data2` should be lists containing numerical values (either integers or floats). Both lists must not be empty to ensure valid statistical analysis.
- The `equal_var` parameter should be a boolean value, where `True` indicates that the variances of the two groups are assumed to be equal.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the results of the t-test, which typically includes:
- `t_statistic`: The calculated t-statistic value.
- `p_value`: The p-value associated with the t-test, indicating the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.
- `degrees_of_freedom`: The degrees of freedom used in the test.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input datasets to ensure they are non-empty and contain numerical values.
- It then calculates the means and standard deviations of both datasets.
- Depending on the `equal_var` flag, the function either:
  - Computes the t-statistic and p-value using the standard independent t-test formula (assuming equal variances).
  - Or, applies Welch's t-test formula (if `equal_var` is `False`), which adjusts for unequal variances.
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the t-statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive summary of the test results.
- The function is registered as a POST endpoint using the `router.post` method, allowing it to handle incoming requests and respond with the statistical analysis results. It may also raise an `APIException` in case of errors during processing, ensuring that clients receive structured error messages.
