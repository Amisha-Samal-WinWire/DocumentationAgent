### perform_ttest(data1: list, data2: list, equal_var: bool = True) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ttest` function is designed to execute an independent two-sample t-test, which assesses whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent datasets. This function is particularly useful in statistical analysis for comparing the means of two groups, assuming that the data is normally distributed.

**Parameters:**
- `data1` (`list`): The first dataset, represented as a list of numerical values (integers or floats) corresponding to the first group.
- `data2` (`list`): The second dataset, also a list of numerical values representing the second group.
- `equal_var` (`bool`, optional): A flag that indicates whether to assume equal variances for the two groups. Defaults to `True`.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `data1` and `data2` should be non-empty lists containing numerical values. They must not be empty to ensure valid statistical analysis.
- The `equal_var` parameter should be a boolean value, where `True` indicates that the variances of the two datasets are assumed to be equal, and `False` indicates that they are not.

**Returns:**
`dict`: The function returns a dictionary containing the results of the t-test, which includes:
- `t_statistic`: The calculated t-statistic value.
- `p_value`: The p-value associated with the t-test, indicating the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.
- `degrees_of_freedom`: The degrees of freedom used in the test.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input datasets to ensure they are non-empty and contain valid numerical values.
- It calculates the means and variances of both datasets.
- Depending on the value of the `equal_var` flag, it computes the t-statistic using the appropriate formula for either equal or unequal variances.
- The p-value is then derived from the t-statistic and the degrees of freedom, which is determined based on the sizes of the input datasets.
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the t-statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom, allowing users to interpret the results of the t-test effectively.

This function is crucial for statistical analysis in various fields, providing a straightforward method to compare two independent groups.
