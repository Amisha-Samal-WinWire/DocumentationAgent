### perform_ttest(sample1: list, sample2: list) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ttest` function conducts an independent two-sample t-test to compare the means of two samples. It assesses whether the means of the two groups are statistically different from each other, returning the t-statistic and the p-value associated with the test.

**Parameters:**
- `sample1` (`list`): The first sample data, which should be a list or a numpy array containing numerical values.
- `sample2` (`list`): The second sample data, which should also be a list or a numpy array containing numerical values.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `sample1` and `sample2` must be lists or numpy arrays containing numerical data. The samples can be of different lengths, and they do not need to have equal variance.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the results of the t-test, specifically:
- `t_statistic` (`float`): The calculated t-statistic value from the t-test.
- `p_value` (`float`): The p-value associated with the t-test, indicating the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `perform_independent_ttest` method from the `StatsService` class, which implements the independent two-sample t-test using the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module.
- It computes the t-statistic and p-value by passing the two samples to the `ttest_ind` function, with the `equal_var` parameter set to `False`, indicating that the function should not assume equal population variances.
- The results are returned as a dictionary containing the t-statistic and p-value, which can be used to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between the two sample means.

### perform_ttest(data1: list, data2: list, equal_var: bool = True) -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ttest` function is designed to execute an independent two-sample t-test, which assesses whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent datasets. This function is integral to statistical analysis, allowing users to compare the means of two groups based on their numerical data.

**Parameters:**
- `data1` (`list`): The first dataset, which contains numerical values representing one group.
- `data2` (`list`): The second dataset, which also contains numerical values representing another group.
- `equal_var` (`bool`, optional): A flag that indicates whether to assume equal variances for the two groups. Defaults to `True`.

**Expected Input:**
- `data1` and `data2` should be non-empty lists containing numerical values (either integers or floats). 
- If `equal_var` is set to `True`, the function assumes that both datasets have the same variance; if set to `False`, it applies Welch's t-test, which is suitable for datasets with unequal variances.

**Returns:**
`dict`: The function returns a dictionary containing the results of the t-test, which typically includes:
- `t_statistic`: The calculated t-statistic value.
- `p_value`: The p-value associated with the t-test, indicating the probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis.
- `degrees_of_freedom`: The degrees of freedom used in the test.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input datasets to ensure they are non-empty and consist solely of numerical values.
- It calculates the means and variances for both datasets.
- Depending on the value of `equal_var`, it either performs a standard independent t-test (assuming equal variances) or Welch's t-test (assuming unequal variances).
- The t-statistic and p-value are computed using the appropriate statistical formulas based on the selected test.
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the t-statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom, enabling users to interpret the results of the t-test effectively. 

This function relies on the `service.perform_independent_ttest` function to perform the actual statistical calculations, ensuring that the logic for conducting the t-test is encapsulated and reusable.
