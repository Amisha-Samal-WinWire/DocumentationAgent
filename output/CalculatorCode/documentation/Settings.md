### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is responsible for managing application settings that are loaded from environment variables. It provides a structured way to access configuration values needed throughout the application, ensuring that these values are consistently retrieved and validated.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon instantiation. Instead, it relies on environment variables to populate its attributes.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to its instantiation. These variables should correspond to the configuration attributes defined within the class. The absence of required environment variables may lead to errors or default values being used.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes its attributes based on the environment variables.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `Settings` class utilizes the `BaseSettings` class from an external library to load and validate configuration values from the environment.
- The class likely defines various attributes that correspond to specific settings required by the application, such as database connection strings, API keys, or feature flags.
- The `Config` class from another external library may be used to provide additional configuration management capabilities, such as validation, type conversion, or default values.
- The logic within the `Settings` class ensures that all necessary settings are retrieved and can be accessed in a consistent manner throughout the application, promoting better maintainability and reducing the risk of misconfiguration.

### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is designed to manage application configuration settings, which are loaded from environment variables. It extends the `BaseSettings` class, leveraging its functionality to provide a structured and consistent way to define, access, and validate application settings.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not define any parameters or attributes directly within its implementation. Instead, it inherits attributes and methods from the `BaseSettings` class, which can be utilized to define specific settings as needed.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to instantiation. These variables should correspond to the specific settings defined in subclasses of `BaseSettings`. The expected data types for these settings may include strings, integers, or booleans, depending on the application's requirements.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return any values directly. Its purpose is to facilitate the management of application settings rather than produce output.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings`, which provides the foundational logic for loading and validating settings. When an instance of `Settings` is created, it automatically loads the configuration settings from the environment variables defined in the operating system.
- The class may include mechanisms for type checking and default values, ensuring that all settings conform to expected formats and types. This enhances the robustness of the application configuration process.
- The specific implementation details of how settings are defined and validated will depend on the attributes and methods provided by the `BaseSettings` class, which `Settings` extends. This allows for a consistent interface across different settings implementations within the application.
