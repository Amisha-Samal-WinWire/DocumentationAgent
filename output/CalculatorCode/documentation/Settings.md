### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is designed to manage application configuration settings, which are loaded from environment variables. It extends the `BaseSettings` class, leveraging its functionality to provide a structured and consistent way to define, access, and validate application settings.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not define any parameters or attributes directly within its implementation. Instead, it inherits attributes and methods from the `BaseSettings` class, which can be utilized to define specific settings as needed.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to instantiation. These variables should correspond to the specific settings defined in subclasses of `BaseSettings`. The expected data types for these settings may include strings, integers, or booleans, depending on the application's requirements.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return any values directly. Its purpose is to facilitate the management of application settings rather than produce output.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings`, which provides the foundational logic for loading and validating settings. When an instance of `Settings` is created, it automatically loads the configuration settings from the environment variables defined in the operating system.
- The class may include mechanisms for type checking and default values, ensuring that all settings conform to expected formats and types. This enhances the robustness of the application configuration process.
- The specific implementation details of how settings are defined and validated will depend on the attributes and methods provided by the `BaseSettings` class, which `Settings` extends. This allows for a consistent interface across different settings implementations within the application.
