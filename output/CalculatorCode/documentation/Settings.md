### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is designed to manage application configuration settings, which are loaded from environment variables. It extends the functionality of the `BaseSettings` class, providing a structured approach to access and validate these settings, ensuring that the application operates with the necessary parameters.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not have any explicitly defined parameters or attributes in the provided context. It inherits attributes and methods from the `BaseSettings` class, which facilitates the management of configuration settings.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects configuration data to be provided through environment variables. These variables should conform to the expected structure defined by the application’s configuration schema, which may include various data types such as strings, integers, or booleans.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any values upon instantiation. Instead, it initializes its internal state based on the environment variables loaded during the instantiation process.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Settings` class likely inherits from the `BaseSettings` class, which includes methods for loading configuration data from environment variables. 
- Upon instantiation, it retrieves the necessary settings from the environment, applying any default values as defined in the schema.
- The class may implement validation logic to ensure that the loaded settings conform to expected types and constraints, raising exceptions or errors when invalid configurations are detected.
- It provides a centralized point for accessing application settings, promoting best practices in configuration management and ensuring that the application can operate correctly with the provided parameters. 
- Overall, the `Settings` class enhances the functionality of `BaseSettings` by specifically focusing on environment variable management for application configuration.
