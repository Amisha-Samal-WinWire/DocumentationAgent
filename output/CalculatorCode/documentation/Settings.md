### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is designed to manage application configuration settings, which are loaded from environment variables. It serves as a structured way to define, access, and validate these settings, ensuring that the application can retrieve configuration values consistently and reliably.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class is expected to be initialized with configuration parameters that are typically provided through environment variables. The specific structure and types of these parameters depend on the application's requirements.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings`, which provides foundational functionality for managing configuration settings. This includes mechanisms for loading settings from various sources, such as environment variables.
- The class may implement validation logic to ensure that the provided settings conform to expected types and constraints, raising errors when invalid configurations are detected.
- It may also provide default values for certain settings, ensuring that the application can operate even if some configurations are not explicitly provided.
- By leveraging the capabilities of `BaseSettings`, the `Settings` class ensures that configuration management is both flexible and robust, allowing for easy integration into different parts of the application without requiring additional dependencies.
