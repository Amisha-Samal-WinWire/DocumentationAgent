### Settings

**Description:**  
The `Settings` class is responsible for managing application settings that are loaded from environment variables. It serves as a centralized configuration point for the application, ensuring that settings can be easily accessed and modified as needed.

**Parameters/Attributes:**  
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon initialization and does not define any attributes explicitly in the provided lines.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to its usage. These environment variables should contain configuration values relevant to the application, such as database connection strings, API keys, or feature flags.

**Returns:**  
- **None**: The class does not return any value upon instantiation.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `Settings` class initializes by reading environment variables that are crucial for the application's configuration.
- It likely utilizes a method or mechanism to fetch these variables, ensuring that the application can adapt to different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) based on the values set in the environment.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, which indicates that it operates independently and does not rely on other modules or classes for its functionality.
- The design promotes the use of environment variables, which is a common practice for managing configuration in modern applications, enhancing security and flexibility.
