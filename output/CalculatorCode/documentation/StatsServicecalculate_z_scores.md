# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_z_scores`

### StatsService.calculate_z_scores(numbers: list) -> list

**Description:**
Calculates the Z-scores for a given list of numbers. The Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset. This method is useful for standardizing data, allowing for comparison across different datasets or distributions.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values for which the Z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a list containing numeric data types (integers or floats). The list must contain at least one element; otherwise, the function may return an error or undefined behavior.

**Returns:**
`list`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input numbers. Each Z-score is a float representing how many standard deviations the original number is from the mean of the list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array for efficient numerical computations.
- It then calculates the mean of the numbers using the `np.mean` function, which computes the average value of the array elements.
- Next, it computes the standard deviation of the numbers using the `np.std` function, which quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
- The Z-scores are calculated by subtracting the mean from each number and dividing the result by the standard deviation. This standardization process transforms the original values into Z-scores.
- Finally, the function rounds the Z-scores to a specified number of decimal places (if applicable) and returns the list of Z-scores, providing a standardized representation of the original data.
