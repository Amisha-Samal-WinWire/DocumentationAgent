# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_z_scores`

### calculate_z_scores(numbers: list) -> list

**Description:**
Calculates the Z-Scores for a given list of numbers. Z-Scores represent the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset. This method is useful in statistical analysis for understanding how far away a particular value is from the average.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the Z-Scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numerical data. It is expected that the list has at least one element; otherwise, the calculation of mean and standard deviation will not be valid.

**Returns:**
`list`: A list of Z-Scores corresponding to each number in the input list. Each Z-Score indicates how many standard deviations the respective number is from the mean of the input list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array for efficient numerical computations.
- It then calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean`, which sums the elements and divides by the count of elements.
- Next, it computes the standard deviation using `np.std`, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
- Finally, the method calculates the Z-Scores by subtracting the mean from each number and dividing the result by the standard deviation. This transformation standardizes the data, allowing for comparison across different datasets or scales.
- The resulting Z-Scores are returned as a list, providing insights into the relative position of each number in the context of the overall dataset.
