# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_z_scores`

### StatsService.calculate_z_scores(numbers: list) -> list

**Description:**
Calculates the Z-scores for a given list of numerical values. The Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset. This method is useful for standardizing data, allowing for comparison across different datasets or distributions.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the Z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numerical data. The list can include any number of elements, but it should not be empty, as Z-scores cannot be calculated without a mean and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`list`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input numbers. Each Z-score indicates how many standard deviations the respective number is from the mean of the input list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array using `np.array`, which allows for efficient numerical operations.
- It then calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean`, which provides the average value of the dataset.
- Next, the standard deviation is computed using `np.std`, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
- The Z-scores are calculated by subtracting the mean from each number and then dividing the result by the standard deviation. This transformation standardizes the data, allowing for comparison across different scales.
- Finally, the method returns a list of the calculated Z-scores, providing insight into the relative position of each number within the dataset.
