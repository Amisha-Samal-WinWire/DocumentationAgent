# Documentation for `zip`

### zip(*iterables: Iterable) -> Iterator[Tuple]

**Description:**
The `zip` function takes multiple iterable objects (like lists, tuples, or strings) and aggregates them into tuples. Each tuple contains elements from the input iterables that are at the same index. The function continues until the shortest input iterable is exhausted, effectively truncating the output to the length of the shortest iterable.

**Parameters:**
- `*iterables` (`Iterable`): One or more iterable objects (e.g., lists, tuples, strings) that will be combined. The function accepts a variable number of arguments.

**Expected Input:**
- The input should consist of one or more iterable objects. Each iterable can be of any type that supports iteration, such as lists, tuples, or strings. There are no specific constraints on the types of elements within the iterables, but all iterables should ideally be of compatible types for meaningful aggregation.

**Returns:**
`Iterator[Tuple]`: An iterator that produces tuples, where each tuple contains elements from the input iterables at the same index. The number of tuples produced will be equal to the length of the shortest input iterable.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by accepting a variable number of iterable arguments.
- It initializes an iterator for each input iterable.
- The function then uses a loop to retrieve the next element from each iterator simultaneously, forming tuples from these elements.
- This process continues until one of the iterators is exhausted, at which point the function stops producing tuples.
- The output is an iterator, allowing for efficient memory usage, as it generates tuples on-the-fly rather than creating a complete list in memory.
- The `zip` function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided iterables.
