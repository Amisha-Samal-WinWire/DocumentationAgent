# Documentation for `zip`

### zip(*iterables: Iterable) -> Iterator[Tuple]

**Description:**
The `zip` function takes multiple iterable objects (such as lists, tuples, or strings) and aggregates them into tuples. Each tuple contains elements from the input iterables that are at the same index. The resulting iterator produces tuples until the shortest input iterable is exhausted.

**Parameters:**
- `*iterables` (`Iterable`): One or more iterable objects (e.g., lists, tuples, strings) that are to be zipped together. The function can accept any number of iterables.

**Expected Input:**
- The input should consist of one or more iterable objects. Each iterable can be of varying lengths, but the output will only include tuples up to the length of the shortest iterable. If no iterables are provided, the function will return an empty iterator.

**Returns:**
`Iterator[Tuple]`: An iterator that produces tuples, where each tuple contains elements from the input iterables at the corresponding index. The length of the output tuples will match the length of the shortest input iterable.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking the provided iterables. It prepares to iterate over them simultaneously.
- It uses an internal mechanism to retrieve elements from each iterable in parallel, creating a tuple for each index.
- The iteration continues until the shortest iterable is exhausted, at which point the function stops producing tuples.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and operates solely on the provided iterables, ensuring efficient memory usage by returning an iterator rather than a list.
