# Documentation for `APP_NAME`

### APP_NAME

**Description:**
`APP_NAME` is a placeholder or identifier used within the codebase to represent the name of the application. It serves as a constant value that can be referenced throughout the application to maintain consistency and facilitate easier updates if the application's name changes.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- `APP_NAME` is expected to be a string that represents the name of the application. There are no specific constraints mentioned, but it is typically expected to be a non-empty string.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- As `APP_NAME` is a constant, it does not involve any complex logic or algorithms. Its primary purpose is to provide a single point of reference for the application name, which can be used in various parts of the codebase.
- By using `APP_NAME`, developers can ensure that any changes to the application's name can be made in one location, thereby reducing the risk of inconsistencies and errors that may arise from hardcoding the name in multiple places.
- There are no external dependencies or interactions with other functions or classes, making `APP_NAME` a straightforward and self-contained element within the codebase.
