# Documentation for `to_dict`

### to_dict() -> dict

**Description:**
The `to_dict` function is designed to convert an object into a dictionary representation. This is particularly useful for serializing objects for storage or transmission, allowing for easy manipulation and access to the object's data in a structured format.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to be called on an object that contains data attributes. The specific structure of the object is not defined within this function, but it should have attributes that can be represented as key-value pairs in a dictionary.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary representation of the object, where each key corresponds to an attribute name and each value corresponds to the attribute's value.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by initializing an empty dictionary to hold the object's attributes.
- It iterates over the object's attributes, typically using built-in functions to retrieve attribute names and values.
- For each attribute, it adds an entry to the dictionary, mapping the attribute name to its corresponding value.
- The resulting dictionary is then returned, providing a complete representation of the object's state.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies, ensuring that it operates solely on the provided object's attributes.
