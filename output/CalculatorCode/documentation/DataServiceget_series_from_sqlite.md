# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_series_from_sqlite(query: str, database_path: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_sqlite` method retrieves a specific column from a SQLite database table and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is particularly useful for extracting single-column data for analysis or further processing.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): A SQL SELECT statement that specifies the column to be retrieved from the SQLite database.
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the data will be fetched.

**Expected Input:**
- `query` must be a valid SQL SELECT statement that targets a specific column in the database. It should be structured correctly to ensure successful execution against the SQLite database.
- `database_path` should be a string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. The path must be accessible, and the database must be in a readable state.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the values from the specified column of the SQLite table. If the query returns no results, an empty Series is returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling `self.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, passing the `query` and `database_path` as arguments. This function executes the SQL query and retrieves the results as a pandas DataFrame.
- Once the DataFrame is obtained, the method extracts the specified column from the DataFrame and converts it into a pandas Series.
- The method handles potential errors that may arise during the data retrieval process, such as invalid SQL syntax or issues with the database connection, by raising a `DataError` exception if necessary.
- Finally, the resulting Series is returned to the caller, providing a straightforward way to access the data extracted from the SQLite database.
