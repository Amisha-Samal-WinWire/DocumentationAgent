# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_series_from_sqlite(query: str, db_path: str) -> pandas.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_sqlite` method retrieves a specific column from a SQLite database table and returns it as a Pandas Series. This method is useful for extracting a single column of data for analysis or manipulation within the Pandas framework.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): A SQL query string that specifies the column to be retrieved from the SQLite database.
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the data will be fetched.

**Expected Input:**
- `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement that targets a specific column in a table within the SQLite database.
- `db_path` should be a string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. The path must be accessible, and the database must be in a readable state.

**Returns:**
`pandas.Series`: A Series containing the values from the specified column of the queried SQLite table. If the query returns no results, an empty Series will be returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` function, passing the `query` and `db_path` parameters to retrieve the relevant data as a Pandas DataFrame.
- It then checks the DataFrame to ensure it contains the expected column. If the column exists, it extracts that column and converts it into a Pandas Series.
- If the column does not exist or if the DataFrame is empty, the method may raise a `DataError` to indicate an issue with the data retrieval process.
- This method leverages the functionality of the Pandas library for data manipulation and assumes that the necessary libraries for SQLite and Pandas are imported and available in the environment.
