# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_series_from_sqlite(query: str, database_path: str) -> pandas.Series

**Description:**
Retrieves a specific column from a SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is designed to facilitate the extraction of data from a SQLite database, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis of the resulting Series.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): A SQL query string that specifies the column to be retrieved from the SQLite database.
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the data will be extracted.

**Expected Input:**
- `query` should be a valid SQL query string that targets a specific column within a table in the SQLite database.
- `database_path` must be a string representing the file path to an existing SQLite database file. The path should be accessible, and the database must be in a readable state.

**Returns:**
`pandas.Series`: A Series containing the values from the specified column as defined by the SQL query. If the query returns no results, an empty Series will be returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first calls `self.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, passing the provided `query` and `database_path` to retrieve the data as a pandas DataFrame.
- It then extracts the specified column from the DataFrame and converts it into a pandas Series.
- If the DataFrame is empty or the specified column does not exist, the method will return an empty Series.
- This method relies on the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method for fetching the initial DataFrame from the SQLite database.
