# Documentation for `cursor.fetchone`

### cursor.fetchone()

**Description:**
The `cursor.fetchone` function is designed to retrieve the next row of a query result set, returning it as a single record. This function is typically used in database operations to fetch data one row at a time, which is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where loading all results at once would be inefficient.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This function does not require any input parameters. It operates on the current state of the cursor, which should already be positioned at a valid result set after executing a query.

**Returns:**
`tuple` or `None`: The function returns a tuple representing the next row in the result set. If there are no more rows to fetch, it returns `None`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `cursor.fetchone` is called, it checks the current position of the cursor within the result set.
- If there are remaining rows, it retrieves the next row and advances the cursor position accordingly.
- The retrieved row is returned as a tuple, where each element corresponds to a column in the result set.
- If the cursor has reached the end of the result set, the function returns `None`, indicating that there are no more rows to fetch.
- This function is typically used in a loop to iterate through all rows of a result set, allowing for efficient data processing without loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
