# Documentation for `cursor.fetchone`

### cursor.fetchone()

**Description:**
The `cursor.fetchone` function is designed to retrieve the next row from the result set of a query executed against a database. It is commonly used in database interaction to fetch a single record at a time, allowing for efficient processing of query results.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This function is typically called after executing a SQL query using a cursor object. The cursor must be positioned at a valid result set, which is usually obtained from a previous query execution.

**Returns:**
`tuple` or `None`: The function returns a tuple representing the next row in the result set. If there are no more rows to fetch, it returns `None`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `cursor.fetchone` is called, it checks the current position of the cursor within the result set.
- If there are remaining rows, it retrieves the next row and advances the cursor position accordingly.
- The retrieved row is returned as a tuple, where each element corresponds to a column in the result set.
- If the cursor has reached the end of the result set (i.e., there are no more rows to fetch), the function returns `None`.
- This function does not perform any additional processing or filtering on the data; it simply retrieves the next available row from the database result set.
