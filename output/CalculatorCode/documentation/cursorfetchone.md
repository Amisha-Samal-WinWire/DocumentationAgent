# Documentation for `cursor.fetchone`

### cursor.fetchone()

**Description:**
The `cursor.fetchone` function is designed to retrieve the next row from the result set of a database query. It is commonly used in database operations to fetch a single record at a time, allowing for efficient processing of query results without loading the entire dataset into memory.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is called on a cursor object that has already executed a database query. The cursor must be positioned at a valid result set, which means a prior call to a query execution method (e.g., `cursor.execute`) must have been made.

**Returns:**
`tuple` or `None`: The function returns a single row from the result set as a tuple, where each element corresponds to a column in the row. If there are no more rows to fetch, it returns `None`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `cursor.fetchone` is invoked, it checks the current position of the cursor within the result set.
- If there are remaining rows, it retrieves the next row, advances the cursor position, and returns the row as a tuple.
- If the cursor has reached the end of the result set, the function returns `None`, indicating that there are no more rows to fetch.
- This function operates in a sequential manner, meaning that each call to `fetchone` will return the next row in the order they were retrieved by the initial query execution.
- It is important to note that this function does not perform any additional database queries or modifications; it solely interacts with the result set obtained from the executed query.
