### ValidationService.__init__(data_service: DataService)

**Description:**  
Initializes the `ValidationService` class, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This service is responsible for validating data inputs and ensuring they meet specified criteria before further processing.

**Parameters:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which provides the necessary data operations that the `ValidationService` will utilize for validation tasks.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `data_service` parameter must be an instance of the `DataService` class. This instance should be properly initialized and ready to perform data-related operations required by the `ValidationService`.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `__init__` method sets up the `ValidationService` by accepting a `DataService` instance as a parameter. This establishes a direct relationship between the two services, allowing the `ValidationService` to leverage the data handling capabilities of the `DataService`.
- The method does not perform any validation or processing itself; it merely prepares the `ValidationService` for use by storing the provided `DataService` instance as an attribute for later access.
- This initialization is crucial for the operation of the `ValidationService`, as it relies on the `DataService` to retrieve and manipulate data during validation processes.
