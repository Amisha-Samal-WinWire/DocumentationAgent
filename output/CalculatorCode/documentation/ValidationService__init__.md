# Documentation for `ValidationService.__init__`

### ValidationService.__init__()

**Description:**
Initializes an instance of the `ValidationService`, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This service is responsible for validating data by leveraging the data loading capabilities provided by the `DataService`, which can load data from various sources, including files and databases.

**Parameters:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which provides methods for loading data into pandas objects from files and databases.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data_service` parameter must be an instance of the `DataService` class. This instance should be fully initialized and capable of performing data loading operations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return any value.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of the `ValidationService` class is called with an instance of `DataService` as an argument.
- This method assigns the provided `DataService` instance to an internal attribute, allowing the `ValidationService` to utilize its methods for data retrieval and manipulation.
- The initialization process ensures that the `ValidationService` is ready to perform data validation tasks by relying on the functionalities offered by the `DataService`, such as loading data from SQLite databases or CSV files.
