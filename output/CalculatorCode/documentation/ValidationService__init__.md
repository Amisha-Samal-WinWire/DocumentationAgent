# Documentation for `ValidationService.__init__`

### ValidationService.__init__(data_service: DataService)

**Description:**
The `__init__` method of the `ValidationService` class initializes an instance of the validation service, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This setup allows the `ValidationService` to leverage the data loading capabilities provided by the `DataService` for validation tasks.

**Parameters:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is responsible for loading data into Pandas DataFrames from various sources such as CSV files and SQLite databases.

**Expected Input:**
- `data_service` should be a valid instance of the `DataService` class. This instance must be properly configured to access the necessary data sources required for validation operations.

**Returns:**
None: The method does not return any value. It initializes the `ValidationService` instance for further use.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method accepts a `DataService` instance as an argument and assigns it to an internal attribute of the `ValidationService` class.
- This internal attribute is then used by other methods within the `ValidationService` to perform data validation tasks, ensuring that the service has access to the necessary data loading functionalities provided by the `DataService`.
- The initialization process sets up the `ValidationService` for subsequent operations, allowing it to interact seamlessly with the data management capabilities of the `DataService`.
