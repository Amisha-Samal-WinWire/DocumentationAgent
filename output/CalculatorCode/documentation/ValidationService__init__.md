# Documentation for `ValidationService.__init__`

<<<<<<< HEAD
### ValidationService.__init__()

**Description:**
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `ValidationService` class, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This setup allows the `ValidationService` to leverage the data loading capabilities provided by the `DataService` for its validation operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is responsible for loading data from various sources such as files and databases. This parameter is essential for the `ValidationService` to perform its validation tasks.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data_service` parameter must be an instance of the `DataService` class. It should be properly initialized and capable of connecting to data sources (e.g., SQLite databases or CSV files) to retrieve data for validation purposes.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return any value. It initializes the instance of the `ValidationService`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method assigns the provided `data_service` instance to an internal attribute of the `ValidationService`. This allows the `ValidationService` to access the methods of `DataService` for data retrieval.
- By establishing this dependency, the `ValidationService` can utilize the data loading functionalities of `DataService`, such as fetching data from SQLite databases or reading from CSV files, which are crucial for its validation processes.
- This initialization ensures that the `ValidationService` is ready to perform its intended operations as soon as an instance is created, with the necessary data service readily available for use.

### ValidationService.__init__(data_service: DataService)

**Description:**
Initializes the `ValidationService` class, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This service is responsible for validating data by leveraging the functionalities provided by the `DataService`, which includes loading data from various sources into pandas objects.

**Parameters:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which provides methods for loading data from files and databases into pandas DataFrames and Series.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data_service` parameter must be an instance of the `DataService` class. This instance should be properly initialized and ready to handle data loading operations. There are no specific constraints on the state of the `DataService` instance, but it should be functional to ensure that the `ValidationService` can perform its tasks effectively.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return any value. It initializes the instance of `ValidationService`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of the `ValidationService` class is called when a new instance of the service is created.
- It takes a single parameter, `data_service`, which is expected to be an instance of the `DataService`.
- This method assigns the provided `data_service` instance to an internal attribute of the `ValidationService`, allowing it to utilize the data loading capabilities of `DataService` in subsequent operations.
- The initialization process does not perform any additional computations or validations beyond setting up the dependency. It ensures that the `ValidationService` is ready to interact with the `DataService` for data validation tasks.
