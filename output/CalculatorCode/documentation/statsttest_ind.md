### stats.ttest_ind(a: array_like, b: array_like, equal_var: bool = True, alternative: str = 'two-sided') -> Ttest_indResult

**Description:**
The `ttest_ind` function performs an independent two-sample t-test to determine if the means of two independent samples are significantly different from each other. This statistical test is commonly used in hypothesis testing to compare the means of two groups.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The first sample data, which can be a list, NumPy array, or any array-like structure containing numerical values.
- `b` (`array_like`): The second sample data, similar to `a`, containing numerical values for comparison.
- `equal_var` (`bool`, optional): A flag indicating whether to assume equal population variances. Defaults to `True`. If set to `False`, Welch’s t-test is performed, which does not assume equal variance.
- `alternative` (`str`, optional): Specifies the alternative hypothesis. Options include:
  - `'two-sided'`: Tests for the possibility of the relationship in both directions (default).
  - `'less'`: Tests if the mean of `a` is less than the mean of `b`.
  - `'greater'`: Tests if the mean of `a` is greater than the mean of `b`.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `a` and `b` should be array-like structures containing numerical data. They can be of different lengths.
- The `equal_var` parameter should be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.
- The `alternative` parameter should be a string that matches one of the specified options.

**Returns:**
`Ttest_indResult`: An object containing the t-statistic and the two-tailed p-value, which indicates the probability of observing the data assuming the null hypothesis is true.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input samples `a` and `b` to ensure they are suitable for statistical analysis.
- It calculates the means and standard deviations of both samples.
- Depending on the `equal_var` parameter, it either calculates the t-statistic using the pooled variance (if `equal_var` is `True`) or uses Welch’s method (if `equal_var` is `False`).
- The degrees of freedom for the test are computed based on the sample sizes and variances.
- Finally, the function computes the p-value associated with the t-statistic, which indicates the likelihood of observing the data under the null hypothesis.
- The results are returned as a `Ttest_indResult` object, encapsulating both the t-statistic and p-value for further interpretation.
