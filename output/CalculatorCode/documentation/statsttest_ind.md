### stats.ttest_ind(a: array_like, b: array_like, equal_var: bool = True, alternative: str = 'two-sided') -> Ttest_indResult

**Description:**
The `ttest_ind` function performs a two-sample t-test to determine if the means of two independent samples are significantly different from each other. This statistical test is commonly used in hypothesis testing to compare the means of two groups.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The first sample data. This can be a list, tuple, or NumPy array containing numerical values.
- `b` (`array_like`): The second sample data, structured similarly to `a`.
- `equal_var` (`bool`, optional): A flag indicating whether to assume equal population variances. If set to `True`, the function uses the standard t-test; if `False`, it applies Welch’s t-test, which is more robust when the variances are unequal. The default value is `True`.
- `alternative` (`str`, optional): Specifies the alternative hypothesis. Options include:
  - `'two-sided'`: Tests if the means are different (default).
  - `'less'`: Tests if the mean of `a` is less than the mean of `b`.
  - `'greater'`: Tests if the mean of `a` is greater than the mean of `b`.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `a` and `b` should be numerical data arrays (lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays) containing observations from two independent samples.
- The data should not contain NaN values, as they may affect the test results.
- The `equal_var` parameter should be a boolean value, and `alternative` should be one of the specified string options.

**Returns:**
`Ttest_indResult`: An object containing the t-statistic and the p-value for the test, along with additional information about the test results.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure that both samples are of compatible shapes and contain valid numerical values.
- It calculates the means and standard deviations of both samples.
- Depending on the `equal_var` parameter, it computes either the standard t-test or Welch’s t-test:
  - For the standard t-test, it assumes equal variances and calculates the pooled standard deviation.
  - For Welch’s t-test, it calculates the standard error using the individual sample variances.
- The t-statistic is computed based on the difference between the sample means, adjusted for the standard error.
- Finally, the function calculates the p-value based on the t-distribution, which indicates the probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis.
- The results, including the t-statistic and p-value, are returned in a structured format for easy interpretation.
