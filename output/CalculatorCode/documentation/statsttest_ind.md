### stats.ttest_ind(a: array_like, b: array_like, equal_var: bool = True, alternative: str = 'two-sided') -> Ttest_indResult

**Description:**
The `ttest_ind` function performs an independent two-sample t-test to determine if the means of two independent samples are significantly different from each other. This statistical test is commonly used in hypothesis testing to compare the means of two groups.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The first sample data. This can be a list, NumPy array, or any array-like structure containing numerical data.
- `b` (`array_like`): The second sample data, structured similarly to `a`.
- `equal_var` (`bool`, optional): A flag indicating whether to assume equal population variances. If `True`, the function uses the standard independent t-test; if `False`, it uses Welch's t-test, which is more robust when the variances are unequal. Default is `True`.
- `alternative` (`str`, optional): Specifies the alternative hypothesis. Options include:
  - `'two-sided'`: Tests if the means are different (default).
  - `'less'`: Tests if the mean of `a` is less than the mean of `b`.
  - `'greater'`: Tests if the mean of `a` is greater than the mean of `b`.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `a` and `b` should be array-like structures containing numerical data. They can be of different lengths.
- The `equal_var` parameter should be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.
- The `alternative` parameter should be a string that matches one of the specified options.

**Returns:**
`Ttest_indResult`: An object containing the t-statistic and the p-value for the test, along with additional information about the test results.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input samples to ensure they are suitable for statistical testing.
- It calculates the means and variances of both samples.
- Depending on the `equal_var` parameter, it either computes the standard t-test or Welch's t-test:
  - For the standard t-test, it assumes equal variances and calculates the pooled variance.
  - For Welch's t-test, it calculates the t-statistic and degrees of freedom without pooling the variances.
- The function then computes the p-value based on the t-statistic and the specified alternative hypothesis.
- Finally, it returns a `Ttest_indResult` object containing the results of the test, which includes the t-statistic and p-value, allowing users to interpret the significance of the results.
