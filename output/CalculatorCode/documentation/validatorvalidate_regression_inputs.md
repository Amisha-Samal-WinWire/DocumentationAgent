# Documentation for `validator.validate_regression_inputs`

### validator.validate_regression_inputs()

**Description:**
Validates the inputs required for regression analysis to ensure they meet the necessary criteria for further processing. This function checks the integrity and appropriateness of the data provided, which is crucial for accurate regression modeling.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`array-like`): The independent variable(s) input data, typically a 2D array or DataFrame containing the features used for prediction.
- `y` (`array-like`): The dependent variable output data, usually a 1D array or Series representing the target values that the model aims to predict.
- `check_shape` (`bool`, optional): A flag indicating whether to check the shapes of `X` and `y` for consistency. Defaults to `True`.
- `check_types` (`bool`, optional): A flag indicating whether to check the data types of `X` and `y` to ensure they are numeric. Defaults to `True`.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` should be a 2D array-like structure (e.g., list of lists, NumPy array, or DataFrame) where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature.
- `y` should be a 1D array-like structure (e.g., list, NumPy array, or Series) containing numeric values corresponding to the observations in `X`.
- If `check_shape` is `True`, `X` and `y` must have compatible dimensions (i.e., the number of rows in `X` must equal the number of elements in `y`).
- If `check_types` is `True`, both `X` and `y` must contain numeric data types (e.g., integers or floats).

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value. Instead, it raises exceptions if the inputs do not meet the validation criteria.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking the shapes of `X` and `y` if `check_shape` is enabled. It raises a `ValueError` if the dimensions do not match.
- Next, if `check_types` is enabled, it verifies that all elements in `X` and `y` are numeric. If any non-numeric values are found, a `TypeError` is raised.
- The function may also include additional checks for common issues such as missing values or infinite values in the datasets, ensuring that the inputs are clean and suitable for regression analysis.
- Overall, this function serves as a preliminary step to safeguard the integrity of the regression modeling process by ensuring that the inputs conform to expected formats and types.
