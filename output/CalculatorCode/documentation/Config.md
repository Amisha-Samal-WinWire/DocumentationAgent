### Config

**Description:**  
The `Config` class serves as a configuration management utility within the application. It is designed to encapsulate configuration settings, providing a structured way to access and manage application-wide settings.

**Parameters/Attributes:**  
- `None`

**Expected Input:**  
- The `Config` class does not take any input parameters upon instantiation. It is expected to be used within the context of the application where configuration settings are required.

**Returns:**  
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `Config` class is initialized without any internal dependencies, indicating that it operates independently within the codebase.
- The class is likely to include methods for retrieving and possibly modifying configuration settings, although specific methods and their functionalities are not detailed in the provided information.
- The class may also include default values or load configurations from external sources (e.g., files, environment variables), but this behavior is not explicitly stated in the current documentation.
- Overall, the `Config` class is intended to streamline the management of configuration settings, ensuring that they can be accessed consistently throughout the application.
