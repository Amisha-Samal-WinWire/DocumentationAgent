# Documentation for `app\services\data_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a foundational component within the `data_service` module, primarily responsible for orchestrating data loading operations. It leverages the `DataService` class to facilitate the retrieval of data from various sources, such as CSV files and SQLite databases, ensuring a seamless interface for users to access and manipulate data efficiently.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module expects valid parameters to be passed to the `DataService` class, specifically:
  - `db_path`: A string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
  - `data_source`: A string indicating the type of data source (e.g., 'csv' or 'sqlite').
  - If `data_source` is 'sqlite', a valid SQL SELECT statement must be provided as `query`.
  - If `data_source` is 'csv', a valid file path to the CSV file must be provided as `file_path`.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: The module returns a DataFrame containing the loaded data, which can either be the contents of a CSV file or the results of a SQL query executed against a SQLite database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module initializes the `DataService` class with the provided parameters that define the data source and its location.
- It determines the type of data source specified by `data_source` and executes the appropriate data loading mechanism:
  - For CSV files, it utilizes `pd.read_csv` to read the data into a DataFrame.
  - For SQLite databases, it establishes a connection using `sqlite3.connect`, executes the provided SQL query with `pd.read_sql_query`, and converts the results into a DataFrame.
- The module includes error handling to manage potential issues during data loading, such as file not found errors or SQL execution errors, raising a `DataError` exception when necessary.
- Ultimately, the loaded DataFrame is returned, enabling users to perform further data manipulation and analysis using the capabilities of the Pandas library.
