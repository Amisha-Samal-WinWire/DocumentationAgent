### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class provides a set of methods for loading data into pandas objects from various sources, including SQLite databases and CSV files. It facilitates data retrieval and manipulation, making it easier to work with structured data in a pandas-friendly format.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- For methods that interact with SQLite databases, the expected input includes:
  - `db_path`: A string representing the path to the SQLite database file.
  - `table_name`: A string representing the name of the table to be queried.
  - `column_name`: A string representing the name of the column to be extracted from the data.
  
- For methods that handle file uploads:
  - `file`: An object representing the uploaded file, which must be a CSV.
  
The class methods enforce constraints such as ensuring the database file exists, the specified table or column exists, and that the uploaded file is of the correct type (CSV).

**Returns:**
- The methods return:
  - A `pandas.DataFrame` when retrieving an entire table from a SQLite database.
  - A `pandas.Series` when extracting a specific column from either a CSV file or a SQLite table.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataService` class contains three primary methods:
  1. **get_dataframe_from_sqlite**: This method connects to a specified SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame. It checks for the existence of the database file and handles exceptions related to database access or empty tables.
  
  2. **get_series_from_file**: This method reads a CSV file and extracts a specified column, returning it as a pandas Series. It validates the file type and checks for the existence of the specified column within the DataFrame created from the CSV file.
  
  3. **get_series_from_sqlite**: This method first calls `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` to retrieve the entire table as a DataFrame and then extracts a specified column from that DataFrame. It ensures that the column exists before returning it.

- The class handles errors gracefully by raising `DataError` exceptions with informative messages, which helps in debugging issues related to data retrieval. The methods utilize pandas for data manipulation and SQLite for database interactions, ensuring efficient data handling and retrieval.
