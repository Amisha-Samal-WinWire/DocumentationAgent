### DataService

**Description:**
The `DataService` class provides functionality for loading data into pandas objects from various sources, including SQLite databases and CSV files. It is designed to facilitate data retrieval for further processing or analysis, making it easier to work with structured data in Python.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- For the method `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, the expected inputs are:
  - `db_path` (`str`): A string representing the file path to the SQLite database.
  - `table_name` (`str`): A string representing the name of the table to be queried.
  
- For the method `get_series_from_file`, the expected inputs are:
  - `file` (`UploadFile`): An object representing the uploaded CSV file.
  - `column_name` (`str`): A string representing the name of the column to be extracted from the CSV file.
  
- For the method `get_series_from_sqlite`, the expected inputs are:
  - `db_path` (`str`): A string representing the file path to the SQLite database.
  - `table_name` (`str`): A string representing the name of the table to be queried.
  - `column_name` (`str`): A string representing the name of the column to be extracted from the table.

**Returns:**
- `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`: Returns a `pd.DataFrame` containing all rows from the specified SQLite table.
- `get_series_from_file`: Returns a `pd.Series` containing the data from the specified column of the uploaded CSV file.
- `get_series_from_sqlite`: Returns a `pd.Series` containing the data from the specified column of the queried SQLite table.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataService` class contains three primary methods:
  1. **get_dataframe_from_sqlite**: This method connects to a SQLite database using the provided database path. It executes a SQL query to select all records from the specified table. If the database file does not exist or the table is empty, it raises a `DataError`. The method returns the entire table as a pandas DataFrame.
  
  2. **get_series_from_file**: This method reads a CSV file and extracts a specified column, returning it as a pandas Series. It first checks if the uploaded file is a CSV and raises an error if not. It reads the content of the file, converts it into a DataFrame, and checks for the existence of the specified column before returning it as a Series.
  
  3. **get_series_from_sqlite**: This method utilizes `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` to retrieve the entire table as a DataFrame and then extracts the specified column, returning it as a Series. It raises an error if the column does not exist in the DataFrame.

- The class is designed to handle exceptions gracefully, raising `DataError` with descriptive messages to inform the user of any issues encountered during data retrieval. This ensures that users can diagnose problems related to file paths, table names, and column names effectively.
