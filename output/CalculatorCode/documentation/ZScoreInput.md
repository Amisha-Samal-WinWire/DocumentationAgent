# Documentation for `ZScoreInput`

### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
`ZScoreInput` is a class that extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, specifically designed to handle inputs related to the calculation of Z-scores. It serves as a structured representation of the data required for Z-score calculations, encapsulating the necessary attributes and behaviors to facilitate these computations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (as `ZScoreInput` does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`).

**Expected Input:**
- `ZScoreInput` is expected to be instantiated without any specific input parameters, as it inherits from `BaseModel`, which does not require constructor parameters. The actual data for Z-score calculations would typically be provided through methods or properties defined within the class or its parent.

**Returns:**
None: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. It is intended to be used as a model for managing Z-score input data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `ZScoreInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the common functionality and structure provided by the base class.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the data necessary for Z-score calculations, although the specific attributes and methods for handling this data are not detailed in the provided information.
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ZScoreInput` can implement its own methods to manipulate or validate the input data relevant to Z-score calculations, leveraging the shared behaviors defined in `BaseModel`.
- The class is primarily focused on providing a clear and consistent interface for managing Z-score input, ensuring that any derived functionality adheres to the standards set by the base model.
