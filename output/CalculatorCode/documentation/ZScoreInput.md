# Documentation for `ZScoreInput`

### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
`ZScoreInput` is a class that extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, designed to facilitate the input and processing of data related to Z-score calculations. It serves as a structured representation of the data required for Z-score computations, ensuring that the input adheres to the expected format and constraints necessary for accurate statistical analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class is expected to handle data inputs that are relevant for Z-score calculations. This typically includes numerical datasets or individual data points that need to be standardized. The class may impose constraints on the type and format of the input data to ensure validity, although specific constraints are not detailed in the provided context.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any values upon instantiation. Instead, it is intended to be used as a structured input model for further processing or calculations related to Z-scores.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `ZScoreInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the shared functionalities and properties defined in the base class. This inheritance allows `ZScoreInput` to maintain a consistent interface with other models in the application.
- The class is likely designed to include methods for validating the input data, ensuring that it meets the necessary criteria for Z-score calculations.
- It may also provide serialization or deserialization capabilities, allowing for easy conversion of input data to and from various formats (e.g., JSON).
- The internal logic of `ZScoreInput` is expected to focus on preparing and validating the data for subsequent statistical operations, although specific methods and behaviors are not detailed in the provided context.
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ZScoreInput` can be extended or modified to accommodate specific requirements or additional functionalities as needed within the application.
