### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
The `ZScoreInput` class is designed to facilitate the calculation of Z-scores, which are statistical measures that describe a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values. This class likely extends functionality from a base model, providing a structured way to input and process data necessary for Z-score calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class is expected to handle data inputs that can be processed to compute Z-scores. This typically includes numerical datasets, which may be provided as lists or arrays. The class may impose constraints on the type of data (e.g., ensuring that the input is numeric) and the structure (e.g., non-empty lists).

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value directly upon instantiation. Instead, it is likely used as part of a larger workflow where methods within the class will perform calculations and return results.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class inherits from the `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may leverage methods and properties defined in the base class for data handling and validation.
- The class is expected to include methods that process input data, calculate the mean and standard deviation, and subsequently compute the Z-scores for the provided dataset.
- Interaction with the `List` type indicates that the class may utilize lists to store input data or intermediate results, ensuring compatibility with Python's type hinting and enhancing code readability.
- The specifics of the Z-score calculation, including how the class handles edge cases (such as empty datasets or non-numeric inputs), would be defined in the methods of the class, although these details are not provided in the current context.

### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
`ZScoreInput` is a class that extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, designed to handle input data specifically for calculating Z-scores. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to manage and process the data inputs needed for Z-score calculations, ensuring that the data adheres to expected formats and constraints.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `ZScoreInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from the `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class is expected to handle input data that is relevant for Z-score calculations. This typically includes numerical datasets that can be processed to compute the mean and standard deviation, from which Z-scores are derived. The class may impose constraints on the type and structure of the input data, ensuring it is suitable for statistical analysis.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. It serves as a data structure for managing input data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for model instances. This inheritance allows `ZScoreInput` to utilize any common methods and properties defined in `BaseModel`, promoting code reuse and consistency.
- The class is likely designed to include methods for validating the input data, ensuring that it meets the necessary criteria for Z-score calculations (e.g., checking for non-empty datasets, ensuring numerical values).
- It may also include methods for processing the input data, such as calculating the mean and standard deviation, which are essential for Z-score computation.
- The internal logic of `ZScoreInput` focuses on preparing the input data for further statistical analysis, ensuring that the data is clean and formatted correctly before any calculations are performed.
