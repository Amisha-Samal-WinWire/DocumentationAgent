# Documentation for `ZScoreInput`

### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
`ZScoreInput` is a class that extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, designed to handle input data specifically for calculating Z-scores. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to manage and process the data inputs needed for Z-score calculations, ensuring that the data adheres to expected formats and constraints.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `ZScoreInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from the `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class is expected to handle input data that is relevant for Z-score calculations. This typically includes numerical datasets that can be processed to compute the mean and standard deviation, from which Z-scores are derived. The class may impose constraints on the type and structure of the input data, ensuring it is suitable for statistical analysis.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. It serves as a data structure for managing input data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ZScoreInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for model instances. This inheritance allows `ZScoreInput` to utilize any common methods and properties defined in `BaseModel`, promoting code reuse and consistency.
- The class is likely designed to include methods for validating the input data, ensuring that it meets the necessary criteria for Z-score calculations (e.g., checking for non-empty datasets, ensuring numerical values).
- It may also include methods for processing the input data, such as calculating the mean and standard deviation, which are essential for Z-score computation.
- The internal logic of `ZScoreInput` focuses on preparing the input data for further statistical analysis, ensuring that the data is clean and formatted correctly before any calculations are performed.
