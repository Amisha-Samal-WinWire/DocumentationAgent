### ZScoreInput

**Description:**  
The `ZScoreInput` class is designed to represent and manage the input data required for calculating the Z-score in statistical analysis. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods to facilitate the handling of data points that will be used in Z-score calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values representing the dataset for which the Z-score will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `data` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (integers or floats). The list must not be empty, as a Z-score calculation requires at least one data point.

**Returns:**  
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `ZScoreInput` class initializes with a list of numerical values, which are stored as an attribute for further processing.
- It does not perform any calculations upon initialization but serves as a structured way to hold the input data for subsequent statistical operations.
- The class is designed to be used in conjunction with other functions or classes that will perform the actual Z-score calculations, leveraging the data stored within `ZScoreInput`.
- There are no internal dependencies, making it a standalone component within the codebase.
