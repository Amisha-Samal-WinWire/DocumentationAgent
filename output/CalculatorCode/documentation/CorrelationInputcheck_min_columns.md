### CorrelationInput.check_min_columns() -> None

**Description:**
The `check_min_columns` method is responsible for validating that the input data contains a minimum number of columns required for further processing. This method ensures that the data structure meets the necessary criteria before any correlation calculations are performed.

### CorrelationInput.check_min_columns() -> None

**Description:**
The `check_min_columns` method is responsible for validating that the minimum number of columns required for correlation analysis is present in the input data. This method ensures that the data structure meets the necessary criteria before proceeding with further calculations or operations.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The method expects the input data to be structured in a way that it can be assessed for the number of columns. Typically, this would be a DataFrame or similar data structure where the number of columns can be easily counted.
- The method may raise a `ValueError` if the input data does not meet the minimum column requirement, indicating that the data is insufficient for the intended calculations.
=======
- The method expects the input data to be structured in a way that allows for column validation, typically as a DataFrame or a similar data structure. The specific criteria for the minimum number of columns required should be predefined within the method or class.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The method utilizes a field validation mechanism to check the number of columns in the input data.
- It compares the actual number of columns against a predefined minimum threshold.
- If the number of columns is less than the required minimum, a `ValueError` is raised, providing feedback to the user about the inadequacy of the input data.
- This validation step is crucial for ensuring that subsequent operations that depend on the presence of sufficient data can be executed without errors.

=======
- The method begins by determining the minimum number of columns required for the correlation analysis.
- It then checks the actual number of columns present in the input data against this minimum requirement.
- If the number of columns is less than the required minimum, the method raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the input data does not meet the necessary criteria for processing.
- This method may utilize the `field_validator` function to perform the validation checks, ensuring that the input adheres to the defined rules for column presence and structure.
- The method is designed to be a safeguard, preventing further processing of invalid data and promoting data integrity within the application.
