# Documentation for `CorrelationInput.check_min_columns`

### CorrelationInput.check_min_columns() -> None

**Description:**  
This method checks whether the minimum required number of columns is present in the input data for correlation analysis. It ensures that the data structure meets the necessary criteria before proceeding with further calculations.

**Parameters:**  
None

**Expected Input:**  
- The method operates on an instance of the `CorrelationInput` class, which is expected to have an internal data structure (such as a DataFrame or similar) that contains the columns to be evaluated. The specific minimum number of columns required is defined within the class.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method assesses the internal data structure of the `CorrelationInput` instance to determine the number of columns present.
- It compares this count against a predefined minimum threshold.
- If the number of columns is below the required minimum, the method may raise an exception or trigger an error handling mechanism, indicating that the input data is insufficient for correlation analysis.
- This method serves as a validation step, ensuring that subsequent operations can be performed without encountering errors due to inadequate data.
