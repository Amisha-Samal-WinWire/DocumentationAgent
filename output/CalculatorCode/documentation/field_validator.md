# Documentation for `field_validator`

### field_validator

**Description:**
The `field_validator` function is designed to validate input fields based on specified criteria. It ensures that the data provided meets certain conditions before it is processed further, helping to maintain data integrity and prevent errors in subsequent operations.

**Parameters:**
- `field_name` (`str`): The name of the field being validated.
- `value` (`Any`): The value of the field that needs to be validated.
- `validation_rules` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the validation rules that the value must satisfy. Each key represents a rule type (e.g., "required", "type", "max_length") and the corresponding value provides the necessary parameters for that rule.

**Expected Input:**
- `field_name` should be a string representing the name of the field.
- `value` can be of any type, depending on the field being validated (e.g., string, integer, etc.).
- `validation_rules` should be a dictionary with specific keys that define the validation criteria. The rules may include:
  - `"required"`: A boolean indicating if the field must be present.
  - `"type"`: The expected data type of the value (e.g., `str`, `int`).
  - `"max_length"`: An integer specifying the maximum allowed length for string values.

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the value passes all validation rules; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if the field is marked as required. If it is, and the value is empty or `None`, the function immediately returns `False`.
- Next, it verifies the type of the value against the specified type in the validation rules. If the type does not match, it returns `False`.
- If a maximum length is specified, the function checks the length of the value (if applicable) and returns `False` if it exceeds the limit.
- If all checks are passed, the function concludes by returning `True`, indicating that the value is valid according to the provided rules.
- The function operates independently without any internal dependencies, relying solely on the parameters passed to it.
