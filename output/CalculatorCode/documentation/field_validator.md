# Documentation for `field_validator`

### field_validator

**Description:**
The `field_validator` function is designed to validate input fields based on specified criteria. It ensures that the data provided meets certain conditions before it is processed further, thereby enhancing data integrity and preventing errors in subsequent operations.

**Parameters:**
- `field_name` (`str`): The name of the field being validated.
- `value` (`Any`): The value of the field that needs to be validated.
- `validation_rules` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the validation rules that the value must satisfy. Each key represents a rule type (e.g., "required", "type", "min_length") and its corresponding value specifies the criteria for that rule.

**Expected Input:**
- `field_name` should be a string representing the name of the field to be validated.
- `value` can be of any type, as it will be validated against the rules provided.
- `validation_rules` should be a dictionary with specific keys that define the validation criteria. The rules may include:
  - `"required"`: A boolean indicating if the field must be present.
  - `"type"`: A type that the value must match (e.g., `int`, `str`).
  - `"min_length"`: An integer specifying the minimum length for string values.

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the value passes all validation rules; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if the field is marked as required. If it is, and the value is `None` or an empty string, the function immediately returns `False`.
- Next, if a type validation rule is specified, the function checks if the value is an instance of the required type. If not, it returns `False`.
- If a minimum length rule is provided, the function verifies that the length of the value meets or exceeds the specified minimum.
- The function may include additional validation checks based on other rules defined in the `validation_rules` dictionary.
- If all checks are passed, the function concludes by returning `True`, indicating that the value is valid according to the specified criteria. 

This function operates independently and does not rely on any external dependencies, making it a versatile component for input validation in various contexts.
