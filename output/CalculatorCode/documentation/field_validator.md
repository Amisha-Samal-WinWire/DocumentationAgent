# Documentation for `field_validator`

### field_validator

**Description:**
The `field_validator` function is designed to validate input fields based on specified criteria. It ensures that the data provided meets certain requirements before further processing or storage. This function is typically used in scenarios where data integrity is crucial, such as form submissions or API requests.

**Parameters:**
- `field_name` (`str`): The name of the field being validated.
- `value` (`Any`): The value of the field that needs to be validated.
- `validation_rules` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the validation rules that the value must adhere to. Each key represents a rule type (e.g., "required", "type", "length") and the corresponding value provides the necessary parameters for that rule.

**Expected Input:**
- `field_name` should be a string representing the name of the field (e.g., "username", "email").
- `value` can be of any type, as it represents the actual data being validated.
- `validation_rules` should be a dictionary with specific keys for validation criteria. For example, it may include:
  - `"required"`: A boolean indicating if the field must be present.
  - `"type"`: A string specifying the expected data type (e.g., "string", "integer").
  - `"length"`: A tuple indicating the minimum and maximum length for string values.

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the value passes all validation rules; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if the field is marked as required. If so, it verifies that the value is not empty or null.
- Next, it checks the type of the value against the specified type in the validation rules. If the type does not match, the function returns `False`.
- If length constraints are provided, the function checks that the length of the value falls within the specified range.
- The function may also include additional validation rules as defined in the `validation_rules` dictionary, applying each rule sequentially.
- If all checks pass, the function concludes by returning `True`, indicating that the value is valid according to the specified criteria. 

This function does not have any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility for field validation.
