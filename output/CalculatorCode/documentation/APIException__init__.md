# Documentation for `APIException.__init__`

### APIException.__init__()

**Description:**
The `APIException.__init__` method is a constructor for the `APIException` class, which is designed to initialize an instance of the exception with specific attributes. This method sets up the exception's message and any additional context that may be necessary for debugging or logging purposes.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A string that describes the error or exception. This message provides context about the nature of the exception.
- `status_code` (`int`, optional): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception. This can be useful for API responses to indicate the type of error that occurred.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a descriptive string that conveys the reason for the exception. It is expected to be non-empty.
- The `status_code` parameter, if provided, should be a valid HTTP status code (e.g., 400 for Bad Request, 404 for Not Found). If not provided, it defaults to a standard error code.

**Returns:**
None. The method initializes the instance of the `APIException` class and does not return any value.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the `super()` function to invoke the constructor of the parent class, ensuring that any initialization logic defined in the superclass is executed. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the exception hierarchy.
- It then assigns the provided `message` to the instance, allowing the exception to carry a meaningful description.
- If a `status_code` is provided, it is also assigned to the instance, enabling the exception to convey relevant HTTP status information when raised.
- This constructor method is essential for creating a well-defined exception that can be raised in response to API-related errors, facilitating better error handling and debugging in the application.
