### APIException.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

**Description:**
The `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur within the API context. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of this exception, allowing for the inclusion of additional context or information related to the error.

**Parameters:**
- `*args`: Variable length argument list that can include any positional arguments intended for the exception message.
- `**kwargs`: Variable length keyword arguments that can include additional context or attributes relevant to the exception.

**Expected Input:**
- The `*args` parameter can accept any number of positional arguments, typically strings that describe the error.
- The `**kwargs` parameter can accept any number of keyword arguments that may provide further details about the exception, such as error codes or additional metadata.

**Returns:**
None: This method does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `APIException` to inherit standard exception behavior.
- By passing `*args` and `**kwargs` to the superclass, the method allows for flexible error messaging and additional context, making it easier to provide detailed information about the error when the exception is raised.
- This design pattern enhances the usability of the exception, enabling developers to create more informative and context-rich error messages when handling API-related issues.

### APIException.__init__(self, message: str, status_code: int)

**Description:**
The `APIException.__init__` method initializes an instance of the `APIException` class, which is designed to handle exceptions that occur within the API layer of the application. This constructor sets up the exception with a specific error message and an associated HTTP status code, allowing for more informative error handling and reporting.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the exception. This message is intended to inform the user or developer about the nature of the error.
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception. This code helps indicate the type of error that occurred (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).

**Expected Input:**
- `message` should be a non-empty string that clearly describes the error encountered.
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically an integer within the range of 100 to 599, representing various categories of HTTP responses.

**Returns:**
None: This method does not return a value. Instead, it initializes the instance of the `APIException` class with the provided parameters.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by invoking the constructor of the parent class using the `super` function. This allows it to inherit and initialize any attributes defined in the superclass, ensuring that the base functionality is preserved.
- The `message` and `status_code` parameters are then assigned to instance attributes, making them accessible for later use when the exception is raised or logged.
- By leveraging the `super` function, the method promotes code reusability and maintains the integrity of the class hierarchy, allowing for a clean and efficient exception handling mechanism within the API.
