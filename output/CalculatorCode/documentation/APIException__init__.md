# Documentation for `APIException.__init__`

### APIException.__init__(self, message: str, status_code: int)

**Description:**
The `APIException.__init__` method initializes an instance of the `APIException` class, which is designed to handle exceptions that occur within the API layer of the application. This constructor sets up the exception with a specific error message and an associated HTTP status code, allowing for more informative error handling and reporting.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the exception. This message is intended to inform the user or developer about the nature of the error.
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception. This code helps indicate the type of error that occurred (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).

**Expected Input:**
- `message` should be a non-empty string that clearly describes the error encountered.
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically an integer within the range of 100 to 599, representing various categories of HTTP responses.

**Returns:**
None: This method does not return a value. Instead, it initializes the instance of the `APIException` class with the provided parameters.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by invoking the constructor of the parent class using the `super` function. This allows it to inherit and initialize any attributes defined in the superclass, ensuring that the base functionality is preserved.
- The `message` and `status_code` parameters are then assigned to instance attributes, making them accessible for later use when the exception is raised or logged.
- By leveraging the `super` function, the method promotes code reusability and maintains the integrity of the class hierarchy, allowing for a clean and efficient exception handling mechanism within the API.
