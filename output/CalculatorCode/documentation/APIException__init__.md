# Documentation for `APIException.__init__`

### APIException.__init__()

**Description:**  
The `APIException.__init__` method is a constructor for the `APIException` class, which is designed to initialize an instance of the exception with specific attributes. This method sets up the necessary properties that define the exception's behavior and message, allowing for consistent error handling in the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the exception.
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception.

**Expected Input:**  
- `message` should be a string that conveys the nature of the error. It can be any descriptive text relevant to the exception being raised.
- `status_code` should be an integer that corresponds to a valid HTTP status code (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).

**Returns:**  
`None`: This method does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `APIException`.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The constructor first calls the parent class's constructor to ensure that any base class initialization is performed.
- It then assigns the provided `message` and `status_code` to the instance attributes, allowing them to be accessed later when the exception is raised or logged.
- This method does not perform any complex logic or calculations; its primary role is to set up the state of the `APIException` instance for use in error handling throughout the application.
