**Dependencies:**
- `super().__init__`
### APIException.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

**Description:**
The `APIException` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur within the API layer of the application. This initializer method sets up the exception instance, allowing it to carry additional context or information about the error that occurred.

**Parameters:**
- `*args`: Variable length argument list that can include any positional arguments passed during the exception instantiation.
- `**kwargs`: Variable length keyword arguments that can include additional context or metadata related to the exception.

**Expected Input:**
- The `*args` parameter can accept any number of positional arguments, which may include error messages or other relevant data.
- The `**kwargs` parameter is expected to contain key-value pairs that provide further details about the exception, such as error codes or specific context related to the API failure.

**Returns:**
None: This method does not return a value; it initializes an instance of the `APIException` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method begins by calling the initializer of its parent class using `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `APIException` to inherit standard exception behavior.
- By using `*args` and `**kwargs`, the method provides flexibility in how the exception can be instantiated, enabling developers to pass various types of information that can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.
- The method does not contain additional logic beyond the call to the parent class's initializer, relying on the inherited functionality to manage the exception's state and behavior.
