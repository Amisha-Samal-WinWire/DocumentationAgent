# Documentation for `super`

### super

**Description:**
The `super` function is a built-in function in Python that returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing access to its methods. It is primarily used in the context of class inheritance to call methods from a parent class without explicitly naming it, thereby facilitating method resolution order (MRO) and promoting code reusability.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `super` function is typically called within a class method, where it is used to refer to the parent class. It does not take any parameters directly but is often used with the class and instance as arguments in the form `super(ClassName, self)`.

**Returns:**
`super`: An object that acts as a proxy to the superclass, allowing access to its methods and properties.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `super` is invoked, it determines the method resolution order (MRO) for the class in which it is called. This order is crucial in multiple inheritance scenarios, as it defines the sequence in which base classes are searched when executing a method.
- The `super` function can be called with two arguments: the class and an instance of that class. This allows it to correctly identify which superclass to refer to, especially in cases of multiple inheritance.
- By using `super`, developers can avoid explicitly naming the parent class, which enhances maintainability and reduces the risk of errors if the class hierarchy changes.
- The primary use case for `super` is to call methods from the parent class, allowing the child class to extend or modify the behavior of those methods while still retaining the functionality of the parent class. This is particularly useful in constructors and overridden methods.
