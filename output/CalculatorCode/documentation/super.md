# Documentation for `super`

### super

**Description:**
The `super` function is a built-in function in Python that returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing access to its methods. It is primarily used in class inheritance to call methods from a parent class without explicitly naming it, which helps in maintaining the code's flexibility and readability.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The `super` function is typically called within a method of a class that inherits from another class. It does not require any parameters when called in this context, but it can take two optional arguments: the class and the instance. The first argument is the class whose methods are to be accessed, and the second is the instance of the class.

**Returns:**
- An instance of the superclass, which allows access to its methods. The type of the returned object is determined by the class hierarchy.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `super` is called, it looks up the method resolution order (MRO) to find the next class in the hierarchy that has the method being called. This is particularly useful in multiple inheritance scenarios, where it helps to avoid ambiguity about which superclass method should be invoked.
- The `super` function can be used in two forms:
  1. `super()` - This form automatically uses the class and instance from which it is called.
  2. `super(class, instance)` - This form explicitly specifies the class and instance, which can be useful in more complex inheritance structures.
- By using `super`, developers can ensure that the correct method from the superclass is called, which is essential for maintaining the intended behavior of inherited classes. This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely based on the class hierarchy defined in the codebase.
