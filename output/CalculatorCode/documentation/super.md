# Documentation for `super`

### super

**Description:**
The `super` function is a built-in function in Python that returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing access to its methods and properties. It is primarily used in class inheritance to call methods from a parent class without explicitly naming it, which helps in maintaining the code's flexibility and readability.

**Parameters:**
- `type` (`type`): The class whose parent class's methods are to be accessed. This is typically the class that is currently being defined.
- `obj` (`object`, optional): An instance of the class. If provided, it allows access to the instance's methods and properties.
- `*args` (`tuple`, optional): Additional positional arguments that can be passed to the method being called from the superclass.

**Expected Input:**
- The `type` parameter should be a class type that is a subclass of another class.
- The `obj` parameter, if provided, should be an instance of the `type` class or its subclasses.
- The `*args` parameter can be any number of additional positional arguments that the superclass method may require.

**Returns:**
`super` returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of the type specified. This proxy object allows access to methods of the superclass.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `super` is called, it first identifies the class hierarchy and determines the next class in line (the superclass) based on the method resolution order (MRO).
- If an instance (`obj`) is provided, `super` binds the method calls to that instance, allowing access to instance variables and methods.
- If no instance is provided, `super` can still be used to call class methods directly on the superclass.
- The use of `super` is particularly beneficial in multiple inheritance scenarios, as it ensures that the correct method from the appropriate superclass is called, adhering to the MRO.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely based on the class hierarchy defined in the codebase.
