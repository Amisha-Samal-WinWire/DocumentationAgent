# Documentation for `JSONResponse`

### JSONResponse

**Description:**
`JSONResponse` is a utility designed to facilitate the creation of HTTP responses in JSON format. It streamlines the process of sending structured data back to clients in a web application, ensuring that the data is correctly formatted as JSON and that appropriate HTTP headers are set for content type.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to be called within the context of a web framework that handles HTTP requests and responses. It typically receives data that needs to be serialized into JSON format, which can include dictionaries, lists, or other serializable objects.

**Returns:**
`JSONResponse`: An object representing the HTTP response, formatted as JSON. This object includes the serialized data and the necessary headers to indicate that the content type is JSON.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon invocation, `JSONResponse` takes the input data and serializes it into a JSON string using a JSON serialization library.
- It sets the appropriate HTTP headers, specifically the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`, ensuring that the client understands the format of the response.
- The response object may also include additional metadata, such as HTTP status codes, which can be customized based on the context of the response (e.g., success, error).
- This function does not have any internal dependencies, relying solely on standard libraries for JSON serialization and HTTP response handling.
