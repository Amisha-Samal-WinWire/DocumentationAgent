# Documentation for `APIRouter`

### APIRouter

**Description:**
`APIRouter` is a class designed to facilitate the routing of API requests within a web application. It serves as a central point for defining and managing the various endpoints that the application exposes, allowing for the organization and handling of HTTP requests and responses in a structured manner.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `APIRouter` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is expected to be used in conjunction with various HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) and associated endpoint handlers that define the behavior of the API.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIRouter` class is responsible for managing the registration of API endpoints. It provides methods to define routes, associate them with specific HTTP methods, and link them to handler functions that process incoming requests.
- When an API request is received, the `APIRouter` checks the request's path and method against its registered routes to determine the appropriate handler to invoke.
- The class may also handle middleware functionality, allowing for pre-processing of requests or post-processing of responses, such as authentication, logging, or error handling.
- Overall, the `APIRouter` acts as an intermediary between the incoming HTTP requests and the application logic, ensuring that requests are directed to the correct handlers based on the defined routing rules.
