# Documentation for `APIRouter`

### APIRouter

**Description:**
`APIRouter` is a class designed to facilitate the creation and management of API routes within a web application. It serves as a central point for defining endpoints, handling requests, and routing them to the appropriate handler functions. This class is essential for organizing the API structure and ensuring that incoming requests are processed efficiently.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `APIRouter` class does not require any parameters upon instantiation.

**Expected Input:**
- The `APIRouter` class is expected to be used within a web application context where it will receive HTTP requests. The specific routes and their corresponding handler functions will be defined by the user of the class.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any value upon instantiation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIRouter` class initializes an internal structure to hold the routes and their associated handler functions.
- It provides methods for adding new routes, which typically include specifying the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and the path for the route.
- When a request is received, the router matches the request's method and path against its defined routes to determine the appropriate handler.
- The class may also include middleware support, allowing for pre-processing of requests before they reach the handler functions.
- Overall, `APIRouter` streamlines the process of managing API endpoints, making it easier to maintain and scale the web application.
