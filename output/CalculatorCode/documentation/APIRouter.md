# Documentation for `APIRouter`

### APIRouter

**Description:**
`APIRouter` is a class designed to facilitate the creation and management of API routes within a web application. It serves as a central point for defining endpoints, handling requests, and routing them to the appropriate handler functions. This class streamlines the process of building RESTful APIs by providing an organized structure for route management.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not have any parameters or attributes defined in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The `APIRouter` class is expected to be instantiated without any parameters. It is designed to work with various route definitions that will be added later through its methods.

**Returns:**
None (the class itself does not return a value upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `APIRouter` class initializes an internal structure to store route definitions and their corresponding handler functions.
- It provides methods to define routes, typically including HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the associated paths.
- When a request is received, the `APIRouter` matches the request path and method against its defined routes to determine the appropriate handler to invoke.
- The class may also include middleware support, allowing for pre-processing of requests or responses before they reach the handler.
- Overall, `APIRouter` abstracts the complexity of routing logic, enabling developers to focus on building the functionality of their API endpoints.
