### StatsService

**Description:**
The `StatsService` class provides a collection of statistical methods for analyzing data stored in an SQLite database. It includes functionalities for loading data into a DataFrame, performing ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, calculating correlation matrices, conducting independent t-tests, and computing various descriptive statistics. This class serves as a utility for statistical analysis and data manipulation, leveraging the capabilities of the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The methods within the `StatsService` class expect inputs primarily in the form of:
  - `db_path`: A string representing the path to the SQLite database.
  - `table_name`: A string representing the name of the table from which to load data.
  - `dependent_var`: A string representing the name of the dependent variable for regression analysis.
  - `independent_vars`: A list of strings representing the names of independent variables for regression analysis.
  - `columns`: A list of strings representing the names of columns for which to calculate the correlation matrix.
  - `sample1` and `sample2`: Lists or numpy arrays representing two samples for the t-test.
  - `data`: A list of numbers for various statistical calculations (e.g., standard deviation, descriptive statistics, Z-scores, confidence intervals).
  - `confidence`: A float representing the confidence level for confidence interval calculations (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Returns:**
- The methods return various types of outputs, including:
  - A summary dictionary containing regression coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and R-squared values from the OLS regression.
  - A dictionary representing the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns.
  - A dictionary containing the t-statistic and p-value from the independent t-test.
  - A float representing the standard deviation of the input data.
  - A dictionary with descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).
  - A list of Z-scores for the input data.
  - A dictionary with the mean, confidence level, and confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `StatsService` class contains several methods that perform specific statistical tasks:
  - **_load_data**: This private method loads data from the specified SQLite database and table into a pandas DataFrame. It utilizes a `data_service` to retrieve the data, allowing for flexibility in selecting specific columns or loading all columns if none are specified.
  - **perform_ols_regression**: This method conducts OLS regression using numpy's least squares function. It prepares the data by loading the relevant columns, constructs the design matrix, and computes regression coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and R-squared values.
  - **calculate_correlation_matrix**: This method calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns in the DataFrame, returning the results as a dictionary.
  - **perform_independent_ttest**: This method performs an independent two-sample t-test on the provided samples, returning the t-statistic and p-value.
  - **calculate_standard_deviation**: This method computes the standard deviation of a list of numbers using numpy's standard deviation function.
  - **calculate_descriptive_stats**: This method calculates various descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation) for a list of numbers and returns them in a dictionary.
  - **calculate_z_scores**: This method computes Z-scores for a list of numbers, standardizing the data based on the mean and standard deviation.
  - **calculate_confidence_interval**: This method calculates the confidence interval for a list of numbers based on the specified confidence level, returning the mean and the interval bounds.

Overall, the `StatsService` class serves as a comprehensive tool for statistical analysis, providing essential methods for data manipulation and statistical computations.
