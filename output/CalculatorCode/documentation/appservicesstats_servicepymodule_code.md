### StatsService

**Description:**
The `StatsService` class provides various statistical analysis methods, including data loading from a SQLite database, performing regression analysis, calculating correlation matrices, conducting t-tests, and computing descriptive statistics. It serves as a utility for statistical computations and data manipulation, primarily using the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy` libraries.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not have attributes defined in the provided code).

**Expected Input:**
- The methods within the `StatsService` class expect specific types of input:
  - `db_path`: A string representing the file path to the SQLite database.
  - `table_name`: A string representing the name of the table from which to load data.
  - `columns`: A list of strings representing the column names to be loaded from the database (optional).
  - `dependent_var`: A string representing the name of the dependent variable for regression analysis.
  - `independent_vars`: A list of strings representing the names of independent variables for regression analysis.
  - `sample1` and `sample2`: Lists or numpy arrays representing the two samples for the independent t-test.
  - `data`: A list of numbers for various statistical calculations (e.g., standard deviation, descriptive statistics, Z-scores, confidence intervals).
  - `confidence`: A float representing the confidence level for confidence interval calculations (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Returns:**
- The methods return various types of data:
  - `_load_data`: Returns a pandas DataFrame containing the loaded data.
  - `perform_ols_regression`: Returns a dictionary summarizing the regression analysis, including coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and R-squared value.
  - `calculate_correlation_matrix`: Returns a dictionary representing the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns.
  - `perform_independent_ttest`: Returns a dictionary containing the t-statistic and p-value from the t-test.
  - `calculate_standard_deviation`: Returns a float representing the standard deviation of the input data.
  - `calculate_descriptive_stats`: Returns a dictionary with descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).
  - `calculate_z_scores`: Returns a list of Z-scores for the input data.
  - `calculate_confidence_interval`: Returns a dictionary with the mean, confidence level, and confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `StatsService` class contains several methods:
  - `_load_data`: Connects to a SQLite database and loads data from a specified table into a pandas DataFrame. It can load all columns or a subset based on the provided column names.
  - `perform_ols_regression`: Loads the specified dependent and independent variables from the database, performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using numpy's least squares method, and returns a summary of the regression results.
  - `calculate_correlation_matrix`: Loads the specified columns from the database and computes the Pearson correlation matrix, returning it as a dictionary.
  - `perform_independent_ttest`: Conducts an independent two-sample t-test on the provided samples and returns the t-statistic and p-value.
  - `calculate_standard_deviation`: Computes the standard deviation of a list of numbers and returns it as a float.
  - `calculate_descriptive_stats`: Calculates various descriptive statistics for a list of numbers and returns them in a dictionary format.
  - `calculate_z_scores`: Computes Z-scores for the input data and returns them as a list.
  - `calculate_confidence_interval`: Calculates the confidence interval for the mean of the input data based on the specified confidence level and returns the results in a dictionary.

Overall, the `StatsService` class serves as a comprehensive tool for performing statistical analyses and data manipulations, leveraging the capabilities of popular data science libraries.
