# Documentation for `app\services\stats_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a foundational component within the `stats_service.py` file, which is part of the applicationâ€™s services for statistical analysis. This module is designed to facilitate the retrieval and processing of statistical data from a SQLite database, leveraging the capabilities of the `StatsService` class. It encapsulates the logic necessary for executing SQL queries and managing the data flow for subsequent statistical computations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module expects valid SQL query strings and a valid path to an SQLite database. The SQL queries should be structured to retrieve data that is suitable for statistical analysis, specifically targeting numerical columns.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` is responsible for orchestrating the interaction between the SQLite database and the `StatsService` class. It utilizes the `StatsService` to execute SQL queries and fetch data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Upon initialization, it may invoke functions to establish a connection to the database and execute the provided SQL query, ensuring that the data retrieved is appropriate for statistical analysis.
- The module does not return values directly but sets up the environment for the `StatsService` to perform its statistical calculations effectively.
- It handles exceptions related to database connectivity and query execution, ensuring that any issues are managed gracefully, thereby enhancing the robustness of the overall statistical analysis process.
