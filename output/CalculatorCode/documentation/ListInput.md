# Documentation for `ListInput`

### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model designed for performing operations on a list of numbers. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, inheriting its properties and methods to ensure consistency and reusability within the application. This class serves as a specialized structure for managing and manipulating collections of numerical data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `ListInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- `ListInput` is expected to handle a list of numerical values (e.g., integers or floats). The class is designed to work with ordered collections, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the list as operations are performed.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `ListInput` class does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it provides methods that may return outputs based on the operations performed on the list of numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ListInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`. This includes any common methods for data validation, serialization, or utility functions that enhance the functionality of the model.
- The class is likely designed to include methods for various operations on the list of numbers, such as adding, removing, or modifying elements, as well as performing calculations or aggregations on the list.
- The internal logic may involve utilizing the `List` class to manage the collection of numbers, leveraging its capabilities for dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation.
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ListInput` promotes code reuse and maintains a consistent interface for interacting with numerical data, ensuring that operations on lists are handled in a structured manner.
