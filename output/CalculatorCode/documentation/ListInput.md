### ListInput

**Description:**  
The `ListInput` class serves as a model for performing operations on a list of numerical values. It encapsulates the functionality required to manage and manipulate a collection of numbers, providing a structured approach to handle list-based calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**  
- The class is designed to work with a list of numbers (e.g., integers or floats). The input list should contain valid numerical values and can be of any length, including an empty list. However, operations performed on the list may have specific requirements regarding the presence of elements (e.g., non-empty lists for certain calculations).

**Returns:**  
- None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `ListInput` class does not have any internal dependencies, indicating that it operates independently within the codebase. The class likely includes methods to perform various operations on the list of numbers, such as addition, subtraction, or statistical calculations. The internal logic would involve iterating over the list, applying mathematical operations, and returning results based on the operations performed. Specific methods and their implementations would define how the class interacts with the list data and what calculations are supported, but these details are not provided in the current context.
