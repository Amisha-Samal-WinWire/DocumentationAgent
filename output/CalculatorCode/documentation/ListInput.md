### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model designed to facilitate operations on a list of numerical values. It serves as a structured representation of a collection of numbers, enabling various mathematical and statistical operations to be performed on the list.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers that the model will operate on. This attribute is essential for the functionality of the class, as it defines the dataset on which operations will be performed.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (specifically, floats). The list can be empty, but it is expected that the operations performed on it will handle such cases appropriately. There are no specific constraints on the size of the list, but operations may vary in performance based on the number of elements.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class itself does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods for performing operations on the list of numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ListInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality and structure for data models.
- The class utilizes the `Field` from an external library to define the `numbers` attribute, ensuring that it is properly validated and managed within the model.
- The primary logic of the class revolves around the manipulation and analysis of the list of numbers, although specific methods for these operations are not detailed in the provided information.
- The class is expected to integrate with other components of the application, allowing for seamless data handling and processing in conjunction with the broader functionality of the calculator module.

### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model designed for performing operations on a list of numbers. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` class, inheriting its properties and methods to ensure consistency and reusability within the application. This class serves as a specialized structure for managing and manipulating collections of numerical data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `ListInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- `ListInput` is expected to handle a list of numerical values (e.g., integers or floats). The class is designed to work with ordered collections, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the list as operations are performed.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `ListInput` class does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it provides methods that may return outputs based on the operations performed on the list of numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ListInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`. This includes any common methods for data validation, serialization, or utility functions that enhance the functionality of the model.
- The class is likely designed to include methods for various operations on the list of numbers, such as adding, removing, or modifying elements, as well as performing calculations or aggregations on the list.
- The internal logic may involve utilizing the `List` class to manage the collection of numbers, leveraging its capabilities for dynamic resizing and efficient element manipulation.
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ListInput` promotes code reuse and maintains a consistent interface for interacting with numerical data, ensuring that operations on lists are handled in a structured manner.
