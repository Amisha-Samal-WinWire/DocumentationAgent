# Documentation for `ListInput`

### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model class designed to perform operations on a list of numbers. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, allowing for the manipulation and processing of numerical data stored in a list format. This class serves as a specialized implementation for handling collections of numeric inputs, facilitating various operations that can be performed on these lists.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list attribute that holds the collection of numbers to be processed. This attribute is expected to be initialized with a list of numeric values.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` attribute should be a list containing numeric values (e.g., integers or floats). The class does not impose restrictions on the length of the list, allowing for both empty and non-empty lists.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it provides methods that may return results based on operations performed on the `numbers` list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `ListInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, gaining access to any shared behaviors or properties defined in the base class.
- The class is designed to encapsulate operations that can be performed on the list of numbers, such as addition, subtraction, or statistical calculations.
- It may implement methods that allow users to manipulate the `numbers` list, including adding new numbers, removing existing ones, or performing calculations like sum, average, or finding maximum and minimum values.
- The internal logic ensures that operations on the list are efficient and maintain the integrity of the data, leveraging the dynamic capabilities of the `List` class for storage and retrieval of numeric values.
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ListInput` promotes code reuse and consistency, allowing for easy integration with other models and components within the application.
