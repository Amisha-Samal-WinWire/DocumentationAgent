# Documentation for `ListInput`

### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model class designed for performing operations on a list of numerical values. It extends the functionality provided by the `BaseModel`, allowing for the encapsulation of behaviors and properties specific to handling collections of numbers. This class is intended to facilitate various calculations and manipulations that can be performed on a list of numbers, promoting code reuse and consistency across the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- `ListInput` is expected to operate on a list of numbers. The specific type of numbers (e.g., integers, floats) is not constrained, allowing for flexibility in the data types used within the list.
- The class may include methods that require a list as input for operations such as addition, subtraction, or other mathematical computations.

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return any value upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `ListInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for the class. This inheritance allows `ListInput` to utilize any shared methods or properties defined in `BaseModel`.
- The class is designed to manage a collection of numbers, likely providing methods for adding, removing, or modifying elements within the list.
- It may include additional functionality for performing calculations on the list, such as summing the numbers, calculating averages, or other statistical operations.
- The internal logic of `ListInput` is expected to leverage the capabilities of the `List` class, which manages the underlying collection of numbers, enabling dynamic manipulation and access to the list elements.
- The class is self-contained and does not rely on external dependencies, ensuring that it can be utilized independently within the broader application context.
