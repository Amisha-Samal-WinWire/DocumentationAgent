# Documentation for `DualInput`

### DualInput

**Description:**
`DualInput` is a model class designed to facilitate operations that require two numerical inputs. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its foundational capabilities while providing a specialized structure for handling dual input scenarios.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle two numerical inputs, though the specifics of how these inputs are provided or utilized are not detailed in the provided context. It is implied that the class will manage these inputs for operations that necessitate dual values.

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return any values upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `DualInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it can utilize any shared methods or properties defined in `BaseModel`. This inheritance allows `DualInput` to maintain a consistent interface with other models in the application.
- The class is intended for operations that require two numbers, suggesting that it may include methods for performing calculations or validations involving these inputs.
- While the specific methods and internal logic of `DualInput` are not provided, it is designed to extend the base functionality of `BaseModel`, allowing for specialized behavior related to dual inputs while leveraging the shared capabilities of its parent class.
