# Documentation for `DualInput`

### DualInput

**Description:**
`DualInput` is a model class designed to facilitate operations that require two numerical inputs. It extends the `BaseModel`, inheriting its foundational properties and behaviors, while specifically catering to scenarios where two distinct numbers are necessary for calculations or operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `DualInput` class does not introduce any new parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `DualInput` class is expected to handle two numerical inputs, though the specifics of how these inputs are managed or validated are not detailed within the class itself. The class is designed to be subclassed or utilized in conjunction with other components that will provide the necessary input handling.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `DualInput` class does not return any values upon instantiation. It serves as a model structure rather than a functional method.

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `DualInput` inherits the common behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`, which may include methods for data validation, serialization, or other utility functions.
- The primary purpose of `DualInput` is to serve as a specialized model that can be extended or utilized in contexts where operations involving two numbers are required. The logic for handling these numbers would typically be implemented in derived classes or through additional methods that interact with the `DualInput` model.
- The class does not contain any internal logic for processing the two numbers directly, but it establishes a framework for future implementations that will leverage its structure for dual-input operations.
