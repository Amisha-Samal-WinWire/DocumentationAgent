### DualInput

**Description:**  
The `DualInput` class serves as a model for operations that require two numerical inputs. It is designed to facilitate calculations or operations that depend on two distinct values, providing a structured way to manage and manipulate these inputs.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**  
- The class is intended to work with two numerical values. These values can be of any numeric type (e.g., integers, floats) and should be provided when creating an instance of the class. There are no specific constraints on the range or type of numbers, but users should ensure that the inputs are valid numbers to avoid errors during operations.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `DualInput` class does not contain any internal methods or dependencies. Its primary purpose is to encapsulate two numerical inputs, which can be utilized in various operations defined in other parts of the codebase.
- The class is likely to be instantiated with two numbers, and while the specific operations are not defined within this class, it serves as a foundational structure for any subsequent calculations or manipulations that require two inputs.
- The simplicity of the class design allows for easy integration with other components of the application that perform operations on pairs of numbers, ensuring that the input handling is consistent and straightforward.
