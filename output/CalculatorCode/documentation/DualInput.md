# Documentation for `DualInput`

### DualInput

**Description:**
`DualInput` is a model class designed to facilitate operations that require two numerical inputs. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, providing a structured way to handle and manipulate pairs of numbers within the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- `DualInput` is expected to handle two numerical values, although the specifics of how these values are provided or utilized are determined by the methods implemented in this class or its subclasses. The class does not impose constraints on the types of numbers, but it is implied that they should be compatible for mathematical operations.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `DualInput` inherits the foundational structure and behaviors defined in `BaseModel`, allowing it to leverage shared functionalities.
- The class is intended to be extended with additional methods that will define how the two numbers are processed or manipulated. The specific operations that can be performed with the two inputs will depend on the implementation details of the derived classes.
- The design promotes code reuse and consistency, ensuring that any operations involving two numbers can be handled uniformly across different contexts within the application.
