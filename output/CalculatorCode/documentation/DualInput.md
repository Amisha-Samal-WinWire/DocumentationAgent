### DualInput

**Description:**
The `DualInput` class serves as a model for operations that require two numerical inputs. It is designed to facilitate calculations or manipulations that involve pairs of numbers, leveraging the structure and functionality provided by its parent class, `BaseModel`.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `DualInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle two numerical inputs, which can be integers or floats. The specific nature of these inputs (e.g., whether they can be negative or zero) may depend on the operations defined in the methods of the class, which are not detailed in the provided information.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return any value upon instantiation. However, it is likely that methods within the class will return results based on the two input numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DualInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which implies that it may utilize or override methods and properties defined in the base class. The main logic of the `DualInput` class revolves around managing and processing two numerical inputs for various operations.
- While the specific operations are not detailed in the provided information, it can be inferred that the class will implement methods that perform calculations or transformations using the two inputs, potentially calling upon methods from `BaseModel` to handle common functionalities or validations.
- The design of the class suggests that it is part of a larger system that may involve multiple models or components, where dual numerical inputs are a common requirement for various calculations.

### DualInput

**Description:**
`DualInput` is a model class designed to facilitate operations that require two numerical inputs. It extends the `BaseModel`, inheriting its foundational properties and behaviors, while specifically catering to scenarios where two distinct numbers are necessary for calculations or operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `DualInput` class does not introduce any new parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `DualInput` class is expected to handle two numerical inputs, though the specifics of how these inputs are managed or validated are not detailed within the class itself. The class is designed to be subclassed or utilized in conjunction with other components that will provide the necessary input handling.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `DualInput` class does not return any values upon instantiation. It serves as a model structure rather than a functional method.

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `DualInput` inherits the common behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`, which may include methods for data validation, serialization, or other utility functions.
- The primary purpose of `DualInput` is to serve as a specialized model that can be extended or utilized in contexts where operations involving two numbers are required. The logic for handling these numbers would typically be implemented in derived classes or through additional methods that interact with the `DualInput` model.
- The class does not contain any internal logic for processing the two numbers directly, but it establishes a framework for future implementations that will leverage its structure for dual-input operations.
