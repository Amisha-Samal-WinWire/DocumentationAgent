### np.var(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, dtype: Optional[type] = None, ddof: int = 0, keepdims: bool = False) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the variance of a given array or dataset. Variance is a statistical measure that represents the degree of spread in a set of values. It quantifies how much the values deviate from the mean of the dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or dataset for which the variance is to be computed. This can be a list, tuple, or a NumPy array.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis along which the variance is computed. If `None`, the variance is computed over the entire array. Default is `None`.
- `dtype` (`Optional[type]`): The data type to use in the computation. If not specified, the function uses the data type of the input array.
- `ddof` (`int`): Delta degrees of freedom. The divisor used in the calculation is `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements. Default is `0`, which computes the population variance.
- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are left in the result as dimensions with size one. This can be useful for broadcasting. Default is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- `a` should be an array-like structure containing numerical data (integers or floats).
- The `axis` parameter can be an integer specifying the dimension along which to compute the variance, or `None` to compute over the entire dataset.
- `dtype` should be a valid NumPy data type if specified.
- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer.
- `keepdims` should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`float`: The computed variance of the input data. If the input is multi-dimensional and `keepdims` is set to `True`, the return value will retain the dimensions of the input array.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input array and determining the appropriate data type for the computation.
- It calculates the mean of the input data along the specified axis.
- The variance is computed by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- If `ddof` is specified, it adjusts the divisor in the variance calculation accordingly.
- The function can handle multi-dimensional arrays and will compute the variance along the specified axis, returning results in the desired shape based on the `keepdims` parameter.
- This function is part of the NumPy library, which provides efficient array operations and mathematical functions, ensuring optimized performance for large datasets.
