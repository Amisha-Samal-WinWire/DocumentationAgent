### np.var(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, dtype: Optional[type] = None, ddof: int = 0, keepdims: bool = False) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the variance of a given array or dataset, which is a measure of the dispersion of the data points around their mean. Variance quantifies how much the values in the dataset differ from the mean value, providing insights into the spread of the data.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or dataset for which the variance is to be computed. This can be a list, tuple, or NumPy array.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis along which the variance is computed. If `None`, the variance is computed over the entire array. Default is `None`.
- `dtype` (`Optional[type]`): The data type to use in the calculation. If not specified, the data type of `a` is used.
- `ddof` (`int`): Delta degrees of freedom. The divisor used in the calculation is `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements. Default is `0`, which computes the population variance.
- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the output as dimensions with size one. This is useful for broadcasting. Default is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- `a` should be an array-like structure containing numerical data (integers or floats).
- `axis` should be an integer that specifies the axis along which to compute the variance, or `None` for the entire array.
- `dtype` should be a valid NumPy data type if specified.
- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer.
- `keepdims` should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`float`: The variance of the input array. If the input is multi-dimensional and `keepdims` is set to `True`, the output will maintain the dimensions of the input array.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input array `a` to ensure it is suitable for variance calculation.
- It then computes the mean of the array along the specified axis.
- The variance is calculated by determining the squared differences between each element and the mean, summing these squared differences, and dividing by `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements along the specified axis.
- If `keepdims` is set to `True`, the output retains the original dimensions of the input array, allowing for easier integration with other operations.
- The function leverages NumPy's efficient array operations to perform calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large datasets.
