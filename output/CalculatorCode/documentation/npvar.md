### np.var(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, dtype: Optional[type] = None, ddof: int = 0, keepdims: bool = False) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the variance of a given array or dataset. Variance is a statistical measure that represents the degree of spread in a set of values. It quantifies how much the values deviate from the mean of the dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or dataset for which the variance is to be computed. This can be a list, tuple, or any array-like structure.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis or axes along which the variance is computed. If `None`, the variance is computed over the entire array. Default is `None`.
- `dtype` (`Optional[type]`): The data type to use in the computation. If not specified, the function will use the data type of the input array.
- `ddof` (`int`): "Delta Degrees of Freedom." The divisor used in the calculation is `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements. Default is `0`, which calculates the population variance. Setting `ddof` to `1` calculates the sample variance.
- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the result as dimensions with size one. This is useful for broadcasting. Default is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `a` should be an array-like structure containing numerical values (integers or floats).
- The `axis` parameter can be an integer specifying a single axis or a tuple of integers for multiple axes. If `None`, the variance is calculated for the flattened array.
- The `dtype` should be a valid data type if specified; otherwise, it defaults to the type of `a`.
- The `ddof` parameter should be a non-negative integer.
- The `keepdims` parameter should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`float`: The variance of the input array along the specified axis. If the input is multi-dimensional and `keepdims` is set to `True`, the result will maintain the dimensions of the input array.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input array `a` to ensure it is array-like and contains numerical values.
- It then checks the specified `axis` to determine how to compute the variance. If `axis` is `None`, it flattens the array and computes the variance across all elements.
- The mean of the array is calculated, and the squared differences from the mean are computed.
- The variance is then calculated by averaging these squared differences, adjusted by the `ddof` parameter to account for either population or sample variance.
- Finally, if `keepdims` is set to `True`, the function reshapes the output to maintain the original dimensions of the input array, allowing for consistent broadcasting in further calculations.
