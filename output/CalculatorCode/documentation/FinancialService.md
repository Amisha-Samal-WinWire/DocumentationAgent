# Documentation for `FinancialService`

### FinancialService

**Description:**
The `FinancialService` class provides a set of methods for performing common financial calculations, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library. This class is designed to facilitate various financial analyses, such as calculating future values, present values, and periodic payments associated with loans and investments.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not have any attributes defined in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The methods within the `FinancialService` class expect parameters that conform to the specifications of the `numpy_financial` functions it utilizes (`npf.fv`, `npf.pv`, and `npf.pmt`).
- Input parameters should adhere to the following constraints:
  - Interest rates must be non-negative floats.
  - The number of periods (`nper`) must be a positive integer.
  - Payment amounts (`pmt`) should be floats, which can be negative if they represent cash outflows.
  - Present values (`pv`) and future values (`fv`) are optional floats, typically representing monetary amounts.
  - The timing of payments (`when`) should be a string, either 'end' or 'begin'.

**Returns:**
The methods of the `FinancialService` class return various float values, depending on the specific financial calculation being performed. These values represent key financial metrics such as future value, present value, or periodic payment amounts.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FinancialService` class encapsulates methods that call the `numpy_financial` functions to perform financial calculations.
- Each method validates its input parameters to ensure they meet the expected types and constraints before proceeding with calculations.
- For future value calculations, the class utilizes the `npf.fv` function, which computes the future value of an investment based on periodic payments and a constant interest rate.
- For present value calculations, it employs the `npf.pv` function to determine the current worth of future cash flows, discounted at the specified interest rate.
- To calculate periodic payments, the class uses the `npf.pmt` function, which derives the fixed payment amount required to amortize a loan or investment over a specified number of periods.
- The class does not maintain any internal state or attributes, focusing solely on providing utility methods for financial computations. Each method operates independently, relying on the input parameters provided by the user.
