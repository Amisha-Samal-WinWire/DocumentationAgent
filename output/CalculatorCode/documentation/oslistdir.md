# Documentation for `os.listdir`

### os.listdir(path: str) -> List[str]

**Description:**
The `os.listdir` function returns a list of the names of the entries in the directory given by the specified path. This includes files, directories, and symbolic links, but does not include the special entries `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory). The order of the entries in the list is arbitrary and may differ between different operating systems.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): A string representing the path to the directory whose contents are to be listed.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a valid directory path as a string. If the path does not exist or is not a directory, an error will be raised. The function can handle both absolute and relative paths.

**Returns:**
`List[str]`: A list of strings, where each string is the name of an entry in the specified directory.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the provided `path` to ensure it points to a valid directory.
- It then retrieves the list of entries in the directory using the underlying operating system's directory listing capabilities.
- The resulting list includes all entries found in the directory, excluding the special entries for the current and parent directories.
- Finally, the function returns this list, allowing the caller to process or iterate over the directory contents as needed. The function does not perform any filtering or sorting of the entries, leaving that responsibility to the caller if desired.
