# Documentation for `cdf`

### cdf

**Description:**
The `cdf` function computes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a specified probability distribution. The CDF is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value. This function is typically used in statistical analysis and probability theory to understand the distribution of data.

**Parameters:**
- `x` (`float`): The value at which the CDF is evaluated. This represents the threshold for which the cumulative probability is calculated.
- `distribution` (`str`): A string indicating the type of probability distribution to use (e.g., "normal", "binomial", etc.). This parameter determines the mathematical model used to compute the CDF.

**Expected Input:**
- `x` should be a numeric value (float) that represents the point of interest in the distribution.
- `distribution` should be a valid string that corresponds to a recognized probability distribution. The function may have specific requirements for the format or values accepted for different distributions.

**Returns:**
`float`: The cumulative probability associated with the input value `x` for the specified distribution. This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the probability of the random variable being less than or equal to `x` is zero, and 1 indicates certainty.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the input parameters to ensure that `x` is a numeric value and `distribution` is a recognized type.
- Depending on the specified distribution, the function applies the appropriate mathematical formula or algorithm to compute the CDF. This may involve using statistical libraries or predefined functions that encapsulate the logic for different distributions.
- The result is then returned as a floating-point number representing the cumulative probability up to the value `x`.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies, relying solely on its parameters to perform the calculations.
