# Documentation for `cdf`

### cdf

**Description:**
The `cdf` function computes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a given statistical distribution. The CDF is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, representing the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value. This function is typically used in statistical analysis and modeling to understand the behavior of random variables.

**Parameters:**
- `x` (`float`): The value at which the CDF is evaluated. This represents the point on the random variable's distribution for which the cumulative probability is calculated.
- `distribution` (`str`): A string indicating the type of distribution for which the CDF is to be computed (e.g., "normal", "exponential", "binomial"). This parameter determines the underlying mathematical model used in the calculation.

**Expected Input:**
- `x` should be a numeric value (float) that represents the point of interest in the distribution.
- `distribution` should be a valid string corresponding to one of the supported distributions. The function may have specific requirements or constraints on the types of distributions it can handle, which should be checked in the implementation or additional documentation.

**Returns:**
`float`: The cumulative probability associated with the input value `x` for the specified distribution. The return value is a probability that ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the likelihood that a random variable from the specified distribution is less than or equal to `x`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure that `x` is a numeric value and that `distribution` is a recognized string.
- Based on the specified distribution, the function applies the appropriate mathematical formula or algorithm to compute the CDF. This may involve using predefined statistical functions or libraries that implement the CDF for various distributions.
- The computed CDF value is then returned as the output of the function.
- Since `cdf` does not have any internal dependencies, it operates independently, relying solely on the provided parameters to perform its calculations.
