# Documentation for `cdf`

### cdf

**Description:**
The `cdf` function computes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a given statistical distribution. The CDF is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, representing the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value. This function is typically used in statistical analysis to understand the distribution of data points and to calculate probabilities associated with random variables.

**Parameters:**
- `x` (`float`): The value at which the CDF is evaluated. This represents the threshold for which the cumulative probability is calculated.
- `distribution` (`str`): A string indicating the type of distribution for which the CDF is to be calculated (e.g., "normal", "binomial", "poisson"). This parameter determines the underlying statistical model used in the computation.

**Expected Input:**
- `x` should be a numeric value (float) that represents the point of interest in the distribution.
- `distribution` should be a valid string corresponding to a recognized statistical distribution. The function may have predefined distributions it can handle, and invalid strings may lead to errors or exceptions.

**Returns:**
`float`: The cumulative probability associated with the input value `x` for the specified distribution. This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the probability of the random variable being less than or equal to `x` is zero, and 1 indicates certainty.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure that `x` is a numeric type and that `distribution` corresponds to a supported distribution.
- Depending on the specified distribution, the function calls the appropriate statistical methods or libraries to compute the CDF. For example, if the distribution is "normal", it may utilize the properties of the normal distribution to calculate the cumulative probability.
- The function then returns the computed CDF value, which represents the cumulative probability up to the point `x`.
- Since `cdf` does not have any internal dependencies, it operates independently, relying solely on the provided parameters and any built-in statistical functions available in the environment.
