### SingleInput

**Description:**  
The `SingleInput` class serves as a model for operations that require a single numerical input. It encapsulates the logic and attributes necessary to handle computations or processes that are based solely on one number.

**Parameters/Attributes:**  
- None

**Expected Input:**  
- The class is designed to accept a single numerical value, which can be an integer or a float. This input should represent the data needed for operations that involve only one number. There are no specific constraints mentioned, but typical use cases would involve valid numerical types.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `SingleInput` class is structured to facilitate operations that revolve around a single numeric value. While the specific methods and functionalities are not detailed in the provided information, it is implied that the class may include methods for processing or manipulating the single input value.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, indicating that it operates independently within the codebase. This design choice allows for straightforward integration into larger systems where single-number operations are required.
- The implementation likely includes initialization methods to set the input value and may provide additional methods for performing calculations or validations based on that input.
