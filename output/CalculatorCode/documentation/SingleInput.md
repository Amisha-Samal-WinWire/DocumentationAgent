# Documentation for `SingleInput`

### SingleInput

**Description:**
The `SingleInput` class is a model designed to handle operations that require a single numerical input. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its properties and methods to ensure consistency and reusability within the application. This class is particularly useful for mathematical operations or calculations that are based on a single value.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `SingleInput` class expects a single numerical value to be provided when performing operations. This value should be of a type that is compatible with mathematical operations (e.g., integer or float).

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `SingleInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`. 
- While the `SingleInput` class itself does not define any additional attributes or methods, it is structured to facilitate operations that require a single number, potentially utilizing methods from `BaseModel` for validation or processing.
- The logic within this class is likely focused on ensuring that the input is valid and can be used in subsequent calculations or operations, leveraging the common functionalities provided by the `BaseModel`.
