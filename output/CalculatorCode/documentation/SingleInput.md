# Documentation for `SingleInput`

### SingleInput

**Description:**
`SingleInput` is a model class designed to handle operations that require a single numerical input. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its properties and methods while focusing specifically on scenarios where only one number is needed for calculations or operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The class is intended to be instantiated with a single numerical value, which represents the input for the operations it will perform. The specific type of this input is typically expected to be a numeric type (e.g., integer or float).

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `SingleInput` inherits the foundational structure and behavior defined in `BaseModel`, which allows it to leverage shared functionalities.
- The class is designed to encapsulate logic that pertains to operations involving a single number, although the specific methods and attributes for handling this input are not detailed in the provided information.
- The implementation may include methods for validating the input, performing calculations, or transforming the input data, but these specifics are not outlined in the current documentation.
- The primary role of `SingleInput` is to serve as a specialized model that focuses on single-number operations, ensuring that any derived functionality adheres to the structure provided by `BaseModel`.
