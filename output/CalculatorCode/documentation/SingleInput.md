### SingleInput

**Description:**
The `SingleInput` class serves as a model for operations that require a single numeric input. It is designed to encapsulate the behavior and properties associated with handling a single number, facilitating various mathematical or computational operations that depend on this input.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to work with a single numeric value, which can be an integer or a float. The input should be validated to ensure it is a number, as the operations performed by this class will depend on numerical computations.

**Returns:**
- None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `SingleInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionalities and properties common to all models in the application. This inheritance suggests that `SingleInput` may utilize or override methods from `BaseModel` to implement specific behaviors related to single numeric inputs.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic for operations that require only one input, which may include mathematical calculations, validations, or transformations.
- While the specific methods and internal logic are not detailed in the provided information, it is implied that the class will include mechanisms to handle the input number effectively, ensuring that it can be processed for various operations as needed.

### SingleInput

**Description:**
The `SingleInput` class is a model designed to handle operations that require a single numerical input. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its properties and methods to ensure consistency and reusability within the application. This class is particularly useful for mathematical operations or calculations that are based on a single value.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `SingleInput` class expects a single numerical value to be provided when performing operations. This value should be of a type that is compatible with mathematical operations (e.g., integer or float).

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `SingleInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`. 
- While the `SingleInput` class itself does not define any additional attributes or methods, it is structured to facilitate operations that require a single number, potentially utilizing methods from `BaseModel` for validation or processing.
- The logic within this class is likely focused on ensuring that the input is valid and can be used in subsequent calculations or operations, leveraging the common functionalities provided by the `BaseModel`.
