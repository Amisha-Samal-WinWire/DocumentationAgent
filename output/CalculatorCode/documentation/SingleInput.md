# Documentation for `SingleInput`

### SingleInput

**Description:**
`SingleInput` is a model class designed to handle operations that require a single numerical input. It serves as a specialized extension of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its foundational capabilities while focusing on scenarios where only one numeric value is necessary for computations or operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to work with a single numeric input, although specific constraints or validation rules for this input are not detailed in the provided context.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- `SingleInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from any shared methods and properties defined in the base class.
- The class is intended to encapsulate logic related to operations that involve a single number, although the specific methods or functionalities are not detailed in the provided context.
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `SingleInput` can override or extend the functionality of its parent class, allowing for tailored behavior while maintaining a consistent interface for model management within the application.
