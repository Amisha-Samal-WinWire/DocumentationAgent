# Documentation for `router.post`

### router.post

**Description:**
The `router.post` function is part of a web framework that facilitates the handling of HTTP POST requests. It is used to define a route that responds to POST requests made to a specific endpoint. This function is essential for creating APIs that accept data from clients, such as form submissions or JSON payloads.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The URL path for which the POST request handler is defined. This path is relative to the base URL of the application.
- `handler` (`Callable`): A function that will be executed when a POST request is made to the specified path. This function typically takes in request and response objects as parameters.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a string representing a valid URL path. It must start with a forward slash (e.g., `/submit`).
- `handler` should be a callable function that can process incoming requests. It should be designed to handle the expected input data format (e.g., JSON, form data) and return an appropriate response.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return a value. Instead, it registers the handler for the specified path, allowing the web framework to invoke it when a matching POST request is received.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the provided `path` to ensure it is a properly formatted string.
- It then associates the `handler` function with the specified `path` in the router's internal routing table.
- When a POST request is received at the defined path, the web framework invokes the registered `handler`, passing the request and response objects to it.
- The `handler` processes the incoming data, performs any necessary operations (such as database interactions or data validation), and sends a response back to the client.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and relies solely on the web framework's routing mechanism to function correctly.
