# Documentation for `router.post`

### router.post

**Description:**
The `router.post` function is part of a web framework that handles HTTP POST requests. It is designed to define a route that listens for incoming POST requests at a specified endpoint and executes a callback function when such requests are received. This functionality is essential for creating RESTful APIs, allowing clients to send data to the server, such as form submissions or JSON payloads.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The URL path at which the POST request will be handled. This should be a string representing the endpoint.
- `handler` (`Callable`): A callback function that will be executed when a POST request is made to the specified path. This function typically takes in request and response objects as parameters.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a valid string that represents the endpoint for the POST request. It can include route parameters and should conform to the routing conventions of the web framework being used.
- `handler` should be a callable function that is capable of processing the incoming request and generating a response. This function may expect specific parameters based on the framework's design, typically including request data and response handling.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return a value. Instead, it registers the handler for the specified path, allowing the web framework to invoke it when a POST request is received.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the provided `path` to ensure it is a properly formatted string.
- It then registers the `handler` function in the internal routing table of the web framework, associating it with the specified path.
- When a POST request is made to the registered path, the framework invokes the `handler`, passing the request and response objects to it.
- The `handler` processes the request, which may involve extracting data from the request body, performing business logic, and sending a response back to the client.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies, relying solely on the framework's routing mechanism to manage incoming requests.
