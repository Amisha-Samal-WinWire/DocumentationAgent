# Documentation for `router.post`

### router.post

**Description:**
The `router.post` function is part of a web framework that facilitates the handling of HTTP POST requests. It is designed to define a route that listens for incoming POST requests at a specified endpoint, allowing the server to process data sent by clients, such as form submissions or JSON payloads.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The URL path at which the POST request handler will be registered. This is the endpoint that clients will use to send their POST requests.
- `handler` (`Callable`): A function that will be invoked when a POST request is received at the specified path. This function typically takes in request and response objects as parameters and contains the logic for processing the incoming data.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a valid string representing the endpoint URL, starting with a forward slash (e.g., `/submit`).
- `handler` should be a callable function that adheres to the expected signature for request handling, typically accepting parameters for the request and response objects.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return a value. Instead, it registers the handler for the specified path within the router, enabling it to respond to incoming POST requests.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the provided `path` to ensure it is a properly formatted string.
- It then associates the `handler` function with the specified `path` in the router's internal routing table.
- When a POST request is made to the defined path, the router invokes the registered handler, passing the request and response objects to it.
- This function does not interact with external modules directly but relies on the routing capabilities of the web framework to manage incoming requests and dispatch them to the appropriate handlers.
