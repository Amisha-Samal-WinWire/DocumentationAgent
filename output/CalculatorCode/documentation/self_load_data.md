The specifics of the data loading process, such as the format and source of the data, are determined by the implementation details of this function.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not take any parameters. However, it is expected to interact with external data sources, which may include files, databases, or APIs. The nature of the data source and its format should be predefined in the implementation.
