# Documentation for `self._load_data`

### _load_data

**Description:**
The `_load_data` function is responsible for loading data from an external source into the application. This function is typically invoked to initialize or refresh the dataset that the application operates on, ensuring that the most current and relevant data is available for processing.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not take any parameters, and therefore does not require any specific input data. It is expected to handle data loading internally, possibly from predefined configurations or external data sources.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value. Its primary purpose is to perform data loading operations, which may include populating internal data structures or updating existing data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `_load_data` function initiates the process of retrieving data from an external source. This may involve connecting to a database, reading from a file, or fetching data from an API.
- The function is designed to handle any necessary data transformations or validations as it loads the data, ensuring that it conforms to the expected format for further processing within the application.
- Although there are no identified internal dependencies, the function may rely on external libraries or services to facilitate data retrieval and manipulation.
- The function is likely to include error handling mechanisms to manage potential issues that may arise during the data loading process, such as connectivity problems or data format mismatches.
