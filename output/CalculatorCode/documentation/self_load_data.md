# Documentation for `self._load_data`

### _load_data()

**Description:**
The `_load_data` function is responsible for loading data from an external source into the current application context. This function is typically invoked to initialize or refresh the dataset that the application operates on, ensuring that the most current data is available for processing or analysis.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not take any parameters, indicating that it may rely on internal state or configuration settings defined elsewhere in the class or module.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `_load_data` function likely interacts with external data sources, such as databases, APIs, or files, to retrieve the necessary data.
- It may include steps to handle data validation, error handling, and data transformation to ensure that the loaded data is in the correct format for subsequent operations.
- The function is expected to update internal data structures or attributes within the class to reflect the newly loaded data.
- As there are no identified internal dependencies, it is assumed that the function operates independently, relying on the external environment for data retrieval.
