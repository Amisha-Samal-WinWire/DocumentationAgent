# Documentation for `all`

### all() -> bool

**Description:**
The `all` function evaluates a collection of boolean values and returns a single boolean result indicating whether all values in the collection are `True`. It is commonly used to determine if a condition holds true for every element in an iterable, such as a list or a tuple.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects an iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set) containing boolean values or values that can be evaluated as boolean (e.g., integers, strings). The iterable should not be empty, as an empty iterable will return `True` by definition.

**Returns:**
`bool`: The function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are `True` or can be evaluated as `True`. If any element is `False` or the iterable is empty, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function iterates through each element of the provided iterable.
- For each element, it checks its truthiness. In Python, values such as `0`, `None`, `False`, and empty collections (like `[]`, `()`, `{}`) are considered `False`, while all other values are considered `True`.
- If it encounters any element that evaluates to `False`, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the iteration completes without finding any `False` values, the function returns `True`.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided iterable, making it efficient for evaluating boolean conditions across collections.
