# Documentation for `all`

### all() -> bool

**Description:**
The `all` function evaluates a collection of boolean values and returns `True` if all values in the collection are `True`. If the collection is empty, it returns `True` by default. This function is commonly used to determine if a set of conditions are all satisfied.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) containing boolean values or values that can be evaluated as boolean (e.g., integers, strings, etc.). The iterable can be empty, in which case the function will return `True`.

**Returns:**
`bool`: The function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are truthy; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function iterates through each element in the provided iterable.
- It evaluates each element's truthiness. If it encounters any element that evaluates to `False`, it immediately returns `False`.
- If the iterable is empty, the function returns `True` as per the convention of logical conjunction.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the input iterable, utilizing basic iteration and boolean evaluation.
