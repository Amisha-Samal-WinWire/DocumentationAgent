# Documentation for `StdDevInput`

### StdDevInput

**Description:**
`StdDevInput` is a model class designed specifically for calculating the standard deviation of a dataset. It inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides foundational functionality and attributes that can be utilized by this class. The primary purpose of `StdDevInput` is to encapsulate the necessary data and methods required for standard deviation calculations, ensuring that the implementation adheres to the structure and conventions established by its parent class.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The `StdDevInput` class is expected to handle a collection of numerical data, typically represented as a list of numbers. The specific format or constraints on the data (e.g., whether it can include non-numeric types) are not detailed in the provided context.

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return any value upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `StdDevInput` extends the functionality of `BaseModel`, inheriting its methods and properties, which may include validation, serialization, and other utility functions.
- The class is intended to be used as part of a larger system for statistical calculations, where it will likely interact with other components that provide data input and output.
- The standard deviation calculation logic itself is not detailed in the provided context, but it typically involves computing the mean of the dataset, then determining the variance by averaging the squared differences from the mean, followed by taking the square root of the variance.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies beyond what is provided by `BaseModel`, ensuring that it remains self-contained and can be utilized in various contexts within the application.
