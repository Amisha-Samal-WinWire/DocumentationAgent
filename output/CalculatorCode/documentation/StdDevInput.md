# Documentation for `StdDevInput`

### StdDevInput

**Description:**
`StdDevInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of the standard deviation of a dataset. It inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides foundational functionality and structure for this and other derived models. The primary purpose of `StdDevInput` is to encapsulate the necessary attributes and methods required to compute the standard deviation, ensuring that the implementation adheres to the principles of object-oriented design.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- `StdDevInput` does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is expected that any derived functionality will handle the input data necessary for standard deviation calculations, typically a collection of numerical values.

**Returns:**
None: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. It is intended to be used as a part of a larger system where methods for calculating standard deviation will return results based on the data processed by instances of this class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `StdDevInput` extends the `BaseModel`, inheriting its properties and methods, which allows it to leverage shared functionality while focusing on the specific requirements for standard deviation calculations.
- The class is designed to handle the input data, which will typically be a list of numerical values. The actual computation of the standard deviation is expected to be implemented in methods that utilize the attributes defined in this class.
- The design promotes code reuse and consistency, as `StdDevInput` can utilize any common methods or properties defined in `BaseModel`, while also allowing for the implementation of specific logic related to standard deviation.
- As a model class, `StdDevInput` serves as a blueprint for creating instances that can be used in conjunction with other components of the application to perform statistical calculations.
