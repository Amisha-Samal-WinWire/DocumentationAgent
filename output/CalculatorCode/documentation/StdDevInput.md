# Documentation for `StdDevInput`

### StdDevInput

**Description:**
`StdDevInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of the standard deviation of a dataset. It inherits from the `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational properties and methods to ensure consistency and reusability within the application. This class encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to compute the standard deviation, making it a crucial component in statistical analysis within the codebase.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `StdDevInput` class does not define any specific parameters or attributes upon instantiation. It relies on the inherited properties from the `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `StdDevInput` class is expected to handle a collection of numerical data (e.g., a list of integers or floats) for which the standard deviation will be calculated. The input data should be valid and non-empty to ensure meaningful statistical computation.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it is expected to include methods that will return the computed standard deviation when invoked.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `StdDevInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a structured foundation for its functionality. While the specific methods for calculating the standard deviation are not detailed in the provided information, it can be inferred that the class will implement statistical algorithms to process the input data.
- The class likely includes methods to:
  - Accept and validate input data.
  - Compute the mean of the dataset as a preliminary step for standard deviation calculation.
  - Calculate the variance by determining the average of the squared differences from the mean.
  - Derive the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.
- The interaction with the `BaseModel` ensures that any common behaviors or properties defined in the base class are available to `StdDevInput`, promoting code reuse and maintaining a consistent interface across different model classes.
