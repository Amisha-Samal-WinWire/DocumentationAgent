### StdDevInput

**Description:**
`StdDevInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of the standard deviation of a dataset. It serves as a structured representation of input data, ensuring that the necessary parameters for standard deviation computation are properly defined and validated.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated. This attribute is essential for the class's functionality.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (floats or integers). The list must not be empty, as standard deviation cannot be computed without at least one data point. Additionally, all elements in the list should be numbers to ensure valid calculations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value directly. Instead, it prepares the data for further processing, such as invoking methods that compute the standard deviation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `StdDevInput` initializes the `data` attribute with the provided list of numerical values.
- The class may include methods to validate the input data, ensuring it meets the criteria for standard deviation calculation (e.g., checking for non-empty lists and numerical types).
- The class is likely designed to work in conjunction with other components of the codebase that perform the actual computation of standard deviation, leveraging the structured input it provides.
- It inherits from `BaseModel`, which may offer additional functionality or validation mechanisms, enhancing the robustness of the `StdDevInput` class. 

This class is a foundational element in the overall architecture for statistical calculations, specifically focusing on standard deviation, and is intended to be used within a broader context of data analysis or mathematical modeling.

### StdDevInput

**Description:**
`StdDevInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of the standard deviation of a dataset. It inherits from the `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational properties and methods to ensure consistency and reusability within the application. This class encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to compute the standard deviation, making it a crucial component in statistical analysis within the codebase.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `StdDevInput` class does not define any specific parameters or attributes upon instantiation. It relies on the inherited properties from the `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The `StdDevInput` class is expected to handle a collection of numerical data (e.g., a list of integers or floats) for which the standard deviation will be calculated. The input data should be valid and non-empty to ensure meaningful statistical computation.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return a value upon instantiation. However, it is expected to include methods that will return the computed standard deviation when invoked.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `StdDevInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a structured foundation for its functionality. While the specific methods for calculating the standard deviation are not detailed in the provided information, it can be inferred that the class will implement statistical algorithms to process the input data.
- The class likely includes methods to:
  - Accept and validate input data.
  - Compute the mean of the dataset as a preliminary step for standard deviation calculation.
  - Calculate the variance by determining the average of the squared differences from the mean.
  - Derive the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.
- The interaction with the `BaseModel` ensures that any common behaviors or properties defined in the base class are available to `StdDevInput`, promoting code reuse and maintaining a consistent interface across different model classes.
