### StdDevInput

**Description:**  
The `StdDevInput` class serves as a model for calculating the standard deviation of a dataset. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods to facilitate the computation of standard deviation, which is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

**Parameters/Attributes:**  
None

**Expected Input:**  
- The class is designed to accept a dataset, typically in the form of a list or array of numerical values, for which the standard deviation will be calculated. 
- The input data should be numeric and can include integers or floating-point numbers. 
- The dataset should contain at least two values to compute a meaningful standard deviation.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `StdDevInput` class does not have any internal dependencies, meaning it operates independently without relying on other classes or functions within the codebase.
- The class is expected to implement methods that will handle the input data, compute the mean of the dataset, and then use that mean to calculate the standard deviation.
- The standard deviation is typically calculated using the formula that involves taking the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- The class may include validation checks to ensure that the input data meets the required criteria for standard deviation calculation, such as checking for sufficient data points and ensuring all values are numeric.
