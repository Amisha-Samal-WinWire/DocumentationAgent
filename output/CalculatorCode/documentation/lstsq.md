# Documentation for `lstsq`

### lstsq

**Description:**
The `lstsq` function computes the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation. It is used to find the best-fitting solution for overdetermined systems, where there are more equations than unknowns. This function minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, which are the differences between the observed and predicted values.

**Parameters:**
- `A` (`ndarray`): A 2D array representing the coefficients of the linear equations.
- `b` (`ndarray`): A 1D or 2D array representing the dependent variable(s) or the output values corresponding to the equations in `A`.
- `rcond` (`float`, optional): A cutoff for small singular values of `A`. Singular values smaller than this value will be considered as zero. If not provided, a default value is used.

**Expected Input:**
- `A` should be a 2D NumPy array with shape `(m, n)`, where `m` is the number of equations and `n` is the number of unknowns.
- `b` should be a 1D or 2D NumPy array with shape `(m,)` or `(m, k)`, where `k` is the number of dependent variables.
- `rcond` should be a non-negative float. If provided, it should be set to a value that is appropriate for the scale of the singular values of `A`.

**Returns:**
- `x` (`ndarray`): The least-squares solution to the linear equations, which is a 1D array of shape `(n,)` or a 2D array of shape `(n, k)` if `b` is 2D.
- `residuals` (`ndarray`): An array containing the sum of the squared residuals for each solution. If the system is underdetermined, this will be an empty array.
- `rank` (`int`): The effective rank of the matrix `A`, which indicates the number of linearly independent rows or columns.
- `singular_values` (`ndarray`): An array of the singular values of `A`, which can be used to assess the condition of the matrix.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix `A` to identify its singular values and vectors.
- It then applies the least-squares formula to compute the solution `x` by using the pseudo-inverse of `A`.
- The residuals are calculated by determining the difference between the observed values `b` and the predicted values obtained from the computed solution.
- The function also checks the rank of the matrix `A` to provide insights into the linear independence of the equations.
- Finally, it returns the computed solution, residuals, rank, and singular values, allowing users to evaluate the quality and reliability of the solution. 

This function is particularly useful in data fitting, regression analysis, and solving systems of linear equations where a direct solution may not be feasible.
