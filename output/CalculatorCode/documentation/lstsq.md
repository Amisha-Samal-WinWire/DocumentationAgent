# Documentation for `lstsq`

### lstsq

**Description:**
The `lstsq` function computes the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation. It is typically used to find the best-fitting line or hyperplane in a multidimensional space by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values).

**Parameters:**
- `A` (`ndarray`): The input matrix representing the coefficients of the linear equations.
- `b` (`ndarray`): The output vector or matrix that represents the dependent variable(s) in the equations.
- `rcond` (`float`, optional): A cutoff ratio for small singular values of `A`. Singular values smaller than this value are considered zero. Default is `None`.

**Expected Input:**
- `A` should be a 2D array (matrix) of shape (m, n) where `m` is the number of equations and `n` is the number of variables.
- `b` should be a 1D or 2D array (vector or matrix) of shape (m,) or (m, k) where `k` is the number of dependent variables.
- `rcond` should be a non-negative float, or `None`. If provided, it should be a small positive value to avoid numerical instability.

**Returns:**
- `x` (`ndarray`): The least-squares solution to the equation `Ax = b`. This is an array of shape (n,) or (n, k) depending on the shape of `b`.
- `residuals` (`ndarray`): The sum of the squared residuals, which indicates how well the solution fits the data. This is an array of shape (k,) if `b` is 2D.
- `rank` (`int`): The effective rank of matrix `A`, which provides insight into the linear independence of the rows or columns.
- `s` (`ndarray`): The singular values of `A`, which can be used to assess the condition of the matrix.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix `A` to identify its singular values and vectors.
- It then applies the least-squares solution formula, which involves solving the normal equations derived from the SVD results.
- The cutoff ratio `rcond` is used to determine which singular values are considered significant, thus influencing the stability of the solution.
- Finally, the function computes the residuals by evaluating the difference between the predicted values (obtained from the solution) and the actual values in `b`.
- The function does not rely on any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility for least-squares calculations.
