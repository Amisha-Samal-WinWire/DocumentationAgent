# Documentation for `lstsq`

### lstsq

**Description:**
The `lstsq` function computes the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation. It is commonly used to find the best-fitting line or hyperplane for a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values).

**Parameters:**
- `A` (`ndarray`): A 2D array representing the coefficients of the linear equations.
- `b` (`ndarray`): A 1D or 2D array representing the dependent variable(s) in the linear equations.
- `rcond` (`float`, optional): A cutoff for small singular values of `A`. Singular values smaller than this threshold are considered zero. The default value is typically set to a small number, which can be adjusted based on the precision required.

**Expected Input:**
- `A` must be a 2D array (matrix) where the number of rows corresponds to the number of observations and the number of columns corresponds to the number of variables.
- `b` can be either a 1D array (single dependent variable) or a 2D array (multiple dependent variables), with the same number of rows as `A`.
- `rcond` should be a non-negative float, and if not provided, defaults to a value determined by the function's internal logic.

**Returns:**
- `x` (`ndarray`): The least-squares solution to the linear equation, which minimizes the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.
- `residuals` (`ndarray`): An array containing the sum of the squared residuals for the solution. If the solution is exact, this will be an empty array.
- `rank` (`int`): The effective rank of the matrix `A`, which indicates the number of linearly independent rows or columns.
- `singular_values` (`ndarray`): An array of singular values of `A`, which can be used to assess the condition of the matrix.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix `A`, which decomposes it into three matrices that can be used to solve the least-squares problem.
- It then identifies the singular values and applies the `rcond` threshold to determine which singular values are considered significant.
- Using the significant singular values, the function computes the least-squares solution by back-substituting to find the optimal coefficients that minimize the residuals.
- The function also calculates the residuals, effective rank, and singular values, providing a comprehensive output that can be used for further analysis or validation of the solution.
- This function does not rely on any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility for least-squares computations.
