# Documentation for `endswith`

### endswith

**Description:**
The `endswith` function checks whether a given string ends with a specified suffix or a tuple of suffixes. It is commonly used to determine if a string concludes with a particular substring, which can be useful for validating file extensions, URL patterns, or other string-based conditions.

**Parameters:**
- `string` (`str`): The string to be checked for the specified suffix.
- `suffix` (`str` or tuple of str): The suffix or tuple of suffixes to check against the end of the string.

**Expected Input:**
- `string` should be a valid string object.
- `suffix` can either be a single string or a tuple containing multiple strings. If a tuple is provided, the function checks if the string ends with any of the suffixes in the tuple.

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the string ends with the specified suffix or any of the suffixes in the tuple; otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by verifying the type of the `suffix` parameter. If it is a string, it proceeds to check if the `string` ends with that specific suffix.
- If `suffix` is a tuple, the function iterates through each suffix in the tuple and checks if the `string` ends with any of them.
- The function utilizes built-in string methods to perform the checks efficiently, ensuring that the operation is optimized for performance.
- There are no external dependencies or complex algorithms involved; the function relies solely on string manipulation capabilities provided by the language's standard library.
