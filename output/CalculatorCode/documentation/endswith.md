# Documentation for `endswith`

### endswith

**Description:**
The `endswith` function checks whether a given string ends with a specified suffix or suffixes. It is commonly used for validating file extensions, ensuring that a string conforms to a particular format, or simply for string manipulation tasks.

**Parameters:**
- `string` (`str`): The string to be checked for the specified suffix.
- `suffix` (`str` or tuple of str): The suffix or a tuple of suffixes to check against the end of the string.
- `start` (`int`, optional): The starting position in the string to begin the search. Defaults to 0.
- `end` (`int`, optional): The ending position in the string to end the search. Defaults to the length of the string.

**Expected Input:**
- `string` must be a valid string object.
- `suffix` can either be a single string or a tuple of strings. If a tuple is provided, the function will check if the string ends with any of the suffixes in the tuple.
- `start` and `end` should be integers that define the substring of `string` to be checked. They must be within the bounds of the string's length.

**Returns:**
`bool`: Returns `True` if the string ends with the specified suffix or any of the suffixes in the tuple; otherwise, returns `False`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input types to ensure that `string` is a string and `suffix` is either a string or a tuple of strings.
- It then checks if the `start` and `end` parameters are within the valid range of the string's indices.
- The function utilizes the built-in string method to perform the check, which efficiently determines if the substring defined by `start` and `end` ends with the specified `suffix`.
- If `suffix` is a tuple, the function iterates through each suffix in the tuple and checks if the string ends with any of them, returning `True` if a match is found.
- If no matches are found, or if the string does not meet the criteria, the function returns `False`. 

This function does not rely on any external dependencies and operates solely on the provided string and its parameters.
