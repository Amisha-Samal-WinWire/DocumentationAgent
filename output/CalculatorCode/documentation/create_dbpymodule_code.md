**Dependencies:**
- `os.path.join`
- `create_sample_database`
### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a module within the `create_db.py` file, primarily responsible for orchestrating the creation of a sample SQLite database populated with housing data. It leverages the `create_sample_database` function to generate the necessary data and establish the database structure, facilitating testing and demonstration of database operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not require any input parameters or external data. It operates independently, generating its own data and managing file and database creation.

**Returns:**
`None`: The module does not return any value. Its purpose is to perform side effects by creating files and a database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module initiates the process by calling the `create_sample_database` function, which is responsible for generating a CSV file containing synthetic housing data.
- It checks for the existence of a directory to store the generated CSV file and creates it if necessary.
- The function then creates a sample DataFrame with housing data, exports it to a CSV file, and establishes a connection to a SQLite database.
- A new table is created within the database to store the housing data, and the data from the DataFrame is inserted into this table.
- The function commits the transaction to save all changes and closes the database connection to release resources.
- Throughout this process, it handles potential errors related to file and database operations, ensuring robust execution.
