### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a utility module designed to facilitate the creation of a sample SQLite database. It primarily leverages the `create_sample_database` function to generate a database populated with sample housing data, which is essential for testing and development purposes.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None: The module operates independently and does not require any external input parameters.

**Returns:**
None: The module does not return any value. It performs actions related to database creation and population.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module begins by invoking the `create_sample_database` function, which is responsible for generating a CSV file containing sample housing data.
- It checks for the existence of the CSV file and removes it if it is found, ensuring that the database is populated with fresh data each time the module is executed.
- The `create_sample_database` function establishes a connection to a new SQLite database, creates a table with a predefined schema, and populates it with data from the generated CSV file.
- Throughout this process, the module handles any potential errors related to file management and database operations, ensuring robust execution and resource management. 

This module is essential for developers needing a quick setup of a test database environment, particularly for applications that require housing data for functionality testing or demonstration purposes.
