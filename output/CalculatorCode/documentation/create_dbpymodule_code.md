### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a utility module designed to facilitate the creation of a sample SQLite database. It leverages the `create_sample_database` function to generate a database populated with sample housing data, which is essential for testing and development purposes.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not require any input parameters. It operates independently, executing its functionality without external input.

**Returns:**
`None`: The module does not return a value; it performs actions to create and populate a database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module begins by checking for the existence of a specific CSV file that contains sample housing data. If the file is found, it is removed to ensure that a new version can be created.
- A new CSV file is generated, containing sample data related to housing attributes.
- The module then establishes a connection to a SQLite database. If the database file does not already exist, it is created automatically.
- A cursor object is created to execute SQL commands, and a SQL command is constructed to create a new table in the database, defining the necessary columns based on the data structure.
- The module reads the data from the newly created CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- The DataFrame is written to the SQL table using the `to_sql` method, which handles the insertion of data into the database.
- Finally, the database connection is closed, ensuring that all resources are properly released and that the database is ready for subsequent operations. 

This module is essential for setting up a test environment that requires housing data, streamlining the process of database creation and population.
