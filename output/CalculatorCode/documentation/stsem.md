# Documentation for `st.sem`

### st.sem

**Description:**
The `st.sem` function is an external function that is likely part of a statistical or mathematical library. Its primary purpose is to calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) from a given dataset. The standard error of the mean is a measure of how much the sample mean of a dataset is expected to vary from the true population mean. This function is essential for statistical analysis, particularly in inferential statistics, where it helps in estimating the precision of sample means.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`array-like`): A collection of numerical values from which the standard error of the mean will be calculated.
- `ddof` (`int`, optional): Delta degrees of freedom. This parameter adjusts the divisor used in the calculation of the standard deviation. The default value is 0, which corresponds to the population standard deviation.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be an array-like structure (such as a list, tuple, or NumPy array) containing numerical values. The values can be integers or floats.
- The `ddof` parameter should be a non-negative integer. If provided, it adjusts the calculation of the standard deviation, which is used to compute the SEM.

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard error of the mean, which represents the estimated standard deviation of the sample mean. If the input data is empty, the function may return `NaN` or raise an error, depending on its implementation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure it is not empty and contains valid numerical values.
- It calculates the standard deviation of the dataset using the specified degrees of freedom (`ddof`).
- The standard error of the mean is then computed by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the number of observations in the dataset.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided input data, making it efficient for calculating the SEM without external calls.
