**Dependencies:**

### ValidationService.validate_correlation_inputs(payload: CorrelationInput)

**Description:**
The `validate_correlation_inputs` method is responsible for validating the inputs required for a correlation analysis. It ensures that the specified columns exist within the provided data and that these columns contain numeric data types. This validation is crucial for preventing errors during the correlation computation process.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the Pydantic model that encapsulates the input data for correlation analysis, including the columns to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` parameter must be an instance of the `CorrelationInput` model, which should contain a list of column names that are intended for correlation analysis. The columns specified must exist in the underlying data structure and must be numeric types (e.g., integers or floats).

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return any value. Its primary function is to validate the input data, raising an exception if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by extracting the column names from the `payload` object.
- It then retrieves the DataFrame that contains the relevant data, likely through a service method that interfaces with a database or data source.
- Using the `select_dtypes` method from the DataFrame, it filters the columns to identify which ones are numeric.
- The method checks if all specified columns from the `payload` exist in the DataFrame and whether they are of a numeric data type by utilizing the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function.
- If any of the specified columns do not exist or are not numeric, the method raises a `DataError` exception, providing feedback on the nature of the validation failure. This ensures that any subsequent analysis using these inputs will not encounter runtime errors due to invalid data types or missing columns.
