### ValidationService.validate_correlation_inputs(payload: CorrelationInput)

**Description:**  
Validates the inputs required for performing a correlation analysis. This method checks whether the specified columns in the provided payload exist and ensures that they contain numeric data types. It is essential for maintaining data integrity before executing correlation computations.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the Pydantic model that encapsulates the input data for correlation analysis. This model defines the structure and constraints for the input data.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `payload` should be an instance of `CorrelationInput`, which must include fields representing the columns intended for correlation analysis. Each specified column must exist in the dataset and must be of a numeric type (e.g., integer or float). If any of these conditions are not met, validation will fail.

**Returns:**  
None: This method does not return a value. Instead, it raises an exception if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method begins by extracting the column names from the `payload` that are intended for correlation analysis.
- It then checks the existence of these columns in the dataset. If any specified column is missing, a `DataError` is raised with a descriptive message indicating which column(s) are absent.
- Following the existence check, the method verifies that each of the specified columns contains numeric data. If any column is found to contain non-numeric data, a `DataError` is raised, detailing the specific column that failed the numeric check.
- This validation process ensures that only valid and appropriate data is used for correlation analysis, thereby preventing runtime errors and ensuring the reliability of the analysis results.
