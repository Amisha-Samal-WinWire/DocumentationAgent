### ValidationService.validate_correlation_inputs(payload: CorrelationInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_correlation_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data required for correlation analysis. It ensures that the specified columns exist within the provided data and that these columns contain numeric data types. This validation is crucial for preventing errors during the correlation computation process.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the Pydantic model that encapsulates the input data for correlation analysis. This model includes the columns that need to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` parameter must be an instance of the `CorrelationInput` model, which should contain a list of column names that are intended for correlation analysis. The columns specified in this model must exist in the underlying data structure and must be numeric types (e.g., integers or floats).

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return a value. Instead, it performs validation checks and raises exceptions if the input data does not meet the required criteria.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by extracting the column names from the `payload` instance.
- It then checks if these columns exist in the underlying data structure (likely a DataFrame).
- Using the `select_dtypes` method from the DataFrame, it filters the columns to identify which ones are numeric.
- The method compares the list of requested columns against the list of existing numeric columns.
- If any of the requested columns are missing or not numeric, the method raises a `DataError` exception, indicating that the validation has failed. This ensures that only valid and appropriate data is used for correlation analysis, thereby maintaining data integrity and preventing runtime errors.
