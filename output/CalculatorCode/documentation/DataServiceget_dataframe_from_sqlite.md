### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite() -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
This method connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame. It is designed to facilitate data extraction for further processing or analysis, making it accessible for other services such as `ValidationService` and `StatsService`.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the SQLite database that is to be converted into a DataFrame.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. If the path does not exist, an error will be raised.
- `table_name` should be a valid string that corresponds to an existing table within the specified SQLite database. If the table does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A pandas DataFrame containing all rows and columns from the specified table in the SQLite database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by checking if the provided database path exists using `os.path.exists`. If the path is invalid, it raises a `DataError` to indicate the issue.
- Upon confirming the existence of the database, it establishes a connection to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`.
- A SQL query is constructed to select all data from the specified table using `pd.read_sql_query`, which executes the query and retrieves the data as a DataFrame.
- After the data is successfully fetched, the database connection is closed using `conn.close` to ensure that resources are released.
- If any errors occur during the data retrieval process, a `DataError` is raised, providing a clear indication of the nature of the issue encountered.

### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite(database: str) -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
The `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method connects to a specified SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a Pandas DataFrame. This function is essential for data retrieval operations, enabling other services, such as `ValidationService` and `StatsService`, to access and manipulate data stored in SQLite databases efficiently.

**Parameters:**
- `database` (`str`): The path to the SQLite database file from which the data will be retrieved.

**Expected Input:**
- `database` must be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. If the specified database does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A Pandas DataFrame containing all the records from the specified table in the SQLite database. The DataFrame structure will reflect the columns and rows of the table.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the `sqlite3.connect` function. This function takes the `database` parameter and attempts to open the specified database file.
- Upon successful connection, the method executes a SQL query to retrieve all records from a predefined table within the database using `pd.read_sql_query`. The SQL query is constructed to select all columns from the table.
- The results of the query are then returned as a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for further data manipulation and analysis.
- Finally, the method ensures that the database connection is properly closed after the data retrieval is complete, preventing resource leaks and maintaining database integrity. If any errors occur during the process, a `DataError` exception may be raised to signal issues related to data retrieval or processing.
