# Documentation for `DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite(database: str) -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
The `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method connects to a specified SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a Pandas DataFrame. This function is essential for data retrieval operations, enabling other services, such as `ValidationService` and `StatsService`, to access and manipulate data stored in SQLite databases efficiently.

**Parameters:**
- `database` (`str`): The path to the SQLite database file from which the data will be retrieved.

**Expected Input:**
- `database` must be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. If the specified database does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A Pandas DataFrame containing all the records from the specified table in the SQLite database. The DataFrame structure will reflect the columns and rows of the table.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the `sqlite3.connect` function. This function takes the `database` parameter and attempts to open the specified database file.
- Upon successful connection, the method executes a SQL query to retrieve all records from a predefined table within the database using `pd.read_sql_query`. The SQL query is constructed to select all columns from the table.
- The results of the query are then returned as a Pandas DataFrame, allowing for further data manipulation and analysis.
- Finally, the method ensures that the database connection is properly closed after the data retrieval is complete, preventing resource leaks and maintaining database integrity. If any errors occur during the process, a `DataError` exception may be raised to signal issues related to data retrieval or processing.
