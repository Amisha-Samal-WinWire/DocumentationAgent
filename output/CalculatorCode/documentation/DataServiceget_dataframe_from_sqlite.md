### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite() -> pandas.DataFrame

**Description:**  
This method connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table, returning the data as a pandas DataFrame. It serves as a foundational utility for other services, specifically `ValidationService` and `StatsService`, enabling them to access and manipulate data stored in SQLite.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**  
- The method expects a valid SQLite database connection to be established prior to its invocation. The specific table to be retrieved is typically defined within the method's implementation, and the database must contain this table for the method to function correctly.

**Returns:**  
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing all rows and columns from the specified table in the SQLite database. If the table does not exist or an error occurs during retrieval, a `DataError` may be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- Upon invocation, the method initiates a connection to the SQLite database.
- It executes a SQL query to select all records from a predefined table.
- The results of the query are then converted into a pandas DataFrame, which allows for easy data manipulation and analysis.
- If any issues arise during the database connection or data retrieval process, the method raises a `DataError`, providing a clear indication of the problem encountered. This custom exception enhances error handling by allowing developers to catch and manage data-related issues effectively.
- The method does not take any parameters, relying instead on the internal configuration for the database connection and the target table.
