# Documentation for `np.abs`

### np.abs(x)

**Description:**
The `np.abs` function computes the absolute value of the input element-wise. It is a part of the NumPy library, which is widely used for numerical computations in Python. The function returns a new array with the absolute values of the elements from the input array, effectively removing any negative signs.

**Parameters:**
- `x` (`array_like`): The input array or scalar for which the absolute values are to be computed. This can be a list, tuple, or a NumPy array.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `x` can be of any numerical type, including integers, floats, or complex numbers. If `x` is a complex number, the function returns the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number.
- The input can be a single value (scalar) or an array-like structure (1D, 2D, etc.).

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A NumPy array of the same shape as `x`, containing the absolute values of the input elements. If the input is a scalar, the output will also be a scalar.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function processes the input `x` by checking its type and structure.
- For each element in the input array, it computes the absolute value:
  - For real numbers, it simply removes any negative sign.
  - For complex numbers, it calculates the magnitude using the formula \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part.
- The output is generated in the same shape as the input, ensuring that the dimensionality is preserved.
- This function is optimized for performance and can handle large arrays efficiently, leveraging NumPy's underlying C implementations for speed.
