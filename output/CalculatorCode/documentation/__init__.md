# Documentation for `__init__`

### __init__()

**Description:**
The `__init__` method serves as the constructor for a class, initializing a new instance of that class. It sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes and preparing it for use.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created.
- It typically accepts parameters that are used to initialize the object's attributes, although in this case, no parameters are specified.
- The method may include logic to set default values for attributes or to perform any necessary setup tasks required for the object to function correctly.
- Since there are no dependencies or additional logic specified, the method is likely straightforward, focusing solely on object instantiation without complex interactions or computations.
