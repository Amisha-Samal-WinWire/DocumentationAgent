### LoanPaymentInput

**Description:**
The `LoanPaymentInput` class is designed to encapsulate the input parameters required for calculating loan payments. It serves as a structured data model that inherits from `BaseModel`, allowing for validation and management of loan-related data inputs.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `loan_amount` (`float`): The total amount of the loan that is being requested or processed.
- `interest_rate` (`float`): The annual interest rate applied to the loan, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
- `loan_term` (`int`): The duration of the loan in months, indicating how long the borrower has to repay the loan.

**Expected Input:**
- `loan_amount` should be a positive float representing the total loan amount.
- `interest_rate` should be a non-negative float, where 0.0 indicates no interest.
- `loan_term` should be a positive integer representing the number of months for repayment.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but initializes an instance with the specified attributes.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `LoanPaymentInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality such as data validation and serialization.
- Each attribute (`loan_amount`, `interest_rate`, `loan_term`) is defined using the `Field` class from an external library, which may include additional validation rules or metadata.
- The class is structured to ensure that any instance created will contain valid loan input data, facilitating the subsequent calculations related to loan payments. The interaction with `BaseModel` and `Field` ensures that the data adheres to expected formats and constraints, promoting robustness in the overall application.
