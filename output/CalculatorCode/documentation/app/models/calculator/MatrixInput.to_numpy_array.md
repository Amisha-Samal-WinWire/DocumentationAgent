### MatrixInput.to_numpy_array() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**
Converts the internal representation of a matrix stored within the `MatrixInput` class into a NumPy array format. This method facilitates the integration of matrix data with NumPy's powerful numerical operations, enabling efficient computations and manipulations.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on an instance of the `MatrixInput` class, which should contain a valid matrix representation (e.g., a list of lists or a similar structure) that can be converted into a NumPy array.

**Returns:**
`np.ndarray`: A NumPy array representation of the matrix stored in the `MatrixInput` instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method accesses the internal matrix data from the `MatrixInput` instance.
- It utilizes the `np.array` function from the NumPy library to convert the internal matrix representation into a NumPy array.
- The resulting NumPy array can then be used for further numerical computations, leveraging NumPy's optimized performance for array operations. This method does not handle any exceptions or errors related to invalid matrix formats; it assumes that the internal data is correctly structured for conversion.
