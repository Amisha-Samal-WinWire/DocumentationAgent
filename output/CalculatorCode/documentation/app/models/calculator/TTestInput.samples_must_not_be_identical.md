### TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical

**Description:**
The `samples_must_not_be_identical` method is a validation function designed to ensure that a set of input samples provided to a test do not consist of identical values. This is crucial for statistical tests where variability in the sample data is necessary to derive meaningful results.

**Parameters:**
- `samples` (`list`): A list of sample values that need to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `samples` parameter should be a list containing numerical or categorical values. The method expects at least two samples to perform the validation. If the list contains fewer than two samples, it will not be able to determine if they are identical.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises a `ValueError` if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first checks if the provided `samples` list contains at least two elements. If not, it will not perform further checks.
- It then compares the unique values in the `samples` list. If the number of unique values is less than two, this indicates that all samples are identical.
- In the case of identical samples, the method raises a `ValueError`, providing a message that indicates the samples must not be identical.
- This method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to enforce the validation rules, ensuring that the input adheres to the expected criteria before proceeding with any further processing.
