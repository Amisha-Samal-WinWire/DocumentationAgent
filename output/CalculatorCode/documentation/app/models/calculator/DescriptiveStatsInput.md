### DescriptiveStatsInput

**Description:**
`DescriptiveStatsInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of descriptive statistics. It serves as a structured input container for the data required to perform statistical analyses, ensuring that the data is organized and accessible for further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not explicitly define any parameters or attributes in the provided context.)

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle input data in a structured format, typically as a list of numerical values. The specific requirements for the input data, such as data types and constraints (e.g., non-empty lists, numerical values), are not detailed in the provided context but are generally implied for statistical calculations.

**Returns:**
- None (The class itself does not return a value; rather, it serves as a data structure for input.)

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DescriptiveStatsInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may leverage functionality provided by this external library, such as validation or serialization of input data.
- The class likely includes methods or properties that allow for the manipulation or retrieval of the input data, although these specifics are not provided in the context.
- As a model for descriptive statistics, it may include functionality to compute various statistical measures (mean, median, mode, etc.) based on the input data, but this behavior is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. 

Overall, `DescriptiveStatsInput` is a foundational component for managing input data in the context of descriptive statistical analysis, ensuring that the data is appropriately structured for subsequent calculations.
