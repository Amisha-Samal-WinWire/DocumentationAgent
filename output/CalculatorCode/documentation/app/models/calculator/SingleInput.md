### SingleInput

**Description:**
The `SingleInput` class serves as a model for operations that require a single numerical input. It is designed to encapsulate the behavior and properties associated with handling a single number, facilitating various calculations or transformations that depend solely on this input.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to operate with a single numerical input, which can be an integer or a float. It is assumed that the input will be valid and within a reasonable range for mathematical operations.

**Returns:**
- None (The class itself does not return a value; it is a model that may provide methods for further operations).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `SingleInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may leverage functionalities defined in the `BaseModel` class. This inheritance allows `SingleInput` to utilize base methods and properties, potentially enabling validation, serialization, or other common model behaviors.
- The class is likely to include methods that perform operations on the single input, although these methods are not detailed in the provided context. The operations may include arithmetic calculations, transformations, or validations specific to the single numerical input.
- The design of this class emphasizes simplicity and focus on a singular input, making it suitable for scenarios where operations are straightforward and do not require multiple inputs.
