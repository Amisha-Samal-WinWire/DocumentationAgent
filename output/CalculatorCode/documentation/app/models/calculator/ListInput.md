### ListInput

**Description:**
`ListInput` is a model class designed to facilitate operations on a list of numerical values. It serves as a structured representation for handling collections of numbers, enabling various mathematical and statistical computations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `numbers` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers that the model operates on. This attribute is essential for the functionality of the class, as it holds the data that will be processed.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (specifically floats). The list can be empty, but it is expected to contain valid numerical entries for most operations. There are no specific constraints on the size of the list, but operations may vary in performance based on the list's length.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; instead, it initializes the internal state with the provided list of numbers.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, `ListInput` takes a list of numbers and stores it as an internal attribute. This allows for subsequent operations to be performed on the list.
- The class likely inherits from `BaseModel`, which may provide additional functionality or structure, such as validation or serialization methods.
- The class may utilize the `Field` class to define the properties of the `numbers` attribute, ensuring that it adheres to expected types and constraints.
- The `ListInput` class is designed to be extensible, allowing for future methods to be added that can perform calculations or manipulations on the list of numbers, such as summation, averaging, or statistical analysis.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `ListInput` class, detailing its purpose, expected behavior, and internal workings.
