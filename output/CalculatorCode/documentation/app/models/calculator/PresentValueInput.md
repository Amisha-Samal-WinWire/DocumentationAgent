### PresentValueInput

**Description:**
The `PresentValueInput` class is designed to encapsulate the input parameters necessary for calculating the present value in financial calculations. It extends the functionality of a base model, likely providing validation and structure to the input data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `amount` (`float`): Represents the present value amount that is being evaluated.
- `rate` (`float`): The interest rate applicable to the present value calculation, expressed as a decimal.
- `time` (`int`): The time period over which the present value is calculated, typically in years.

**Expected Input:**
- `amount` should be a positive float, indicating the monetary value to be evaluated.
- `rate` should be a non-negative float, representing the interest rate (0.0 indicates no interest).
- `time` should be a positive integer, indicating the duration for which the present value is calculated.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value but is used to create an instance that holds the input data for further processing.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `PresentValueInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational methods and properties for data handling and validation.
- It utilizes the `Field` class to define its attributes, which may include validation rules, default values, and metadata for each field.
- The class is structured to ensure that the input values for amount, rate, and time are correctly formatted and validated before being used in calculations.
- This class serves as a data structure that can be utilized in conjunction with other financial calculation functions or classes, ensuring that the necessary input parameters are consistently managed and validated.
