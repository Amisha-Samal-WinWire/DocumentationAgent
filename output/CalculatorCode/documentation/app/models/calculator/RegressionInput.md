### RegressionInput

**Description:**
The `RegressionInput` class serves as a model for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It is designed to ensure that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby preventing issues that may arise from multicollinearity. This class is part of a larger application that likely involves statistical modeling and data analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not explicitly define any parameters or attributes in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `RegressionInput` class is expected to receive data that includes multiple independent variables for regression analysis. Each variable must be distinct to maintain the integrity of the regression model. The specific data types and structures are not detailed in the provided context, but they should conform to the requirements of the OLS regression methodology.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any values upon instantiation. Instead, it is used to validate and prepare the input data for further processing in regression analysis.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `RegressionInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may leverage functionalities provided by this external library, such as data validation and model management.
- The class utilizes the `Field` and `field_validator` components from external libraries to define and validate the input fields. This ensures that the variables are not only distinct but also meet any additional validation criteria defined within the class.
- If the input data does not satisfy the distinctness requirement, a `ValueError` may be raised, indicating that the input is invalid for OLS regression.
- The class encapsulates the logic necessary to prepare the input data for regression analysis, ensuring that it adheres to the necessary statistical assumptions.
