### DualInput

**Description:**
The `DualInput` class serves as a model for operations that require two numerical inputs. It is designed to facilitate calculations or processes that depend on the interaction of two distinct numbers, making it suitable for various mathematical operations or algorithms that necessitate dual input values.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The `DualInput` class is expected to work with two numerical values, which could be integers or floats. These values should be provided in a manner that allows the class to perform operations on them, although the specific method of input is not detailed in the provided context.

**Returns:**
- None (The class itself does not return a value; rather, it is a model that may be used in conjunction with other methods or classes to perform operations).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DualInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may utilize or override methods and properties defined in the `BaseModel` class. The exact interactions and functionalities provided by `BaseModel` are not specified, but it is likely that `DualInput` leverages its capabilities to manage or validate the two input numbers.
- The class is intended to encapsulate the logic necessary for operations involving two numbers, although the specific operations or methods that utilize these inputs are not detailed in the provided context. The implementation may include methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, or other calculations that require both inputs to function correctly.
