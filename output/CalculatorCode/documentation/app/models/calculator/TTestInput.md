### TTestInput

**Description:**
`TTestInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the validation and handling of data for performing an independent t-test. It ensures that the samples provided for the t-test are not identical, which is a prerequisite for the validity of the test results.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not have any parameters or attributes explicitly defined in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects input samples that are numerical arrays or lists. These samples must be distinct; if identical samples are provided, the class will raise a validation error. The specific structure or format of the input samples is not detailed, but they should conform to standard numerical data types.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a model for validating input data for the t-test.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, `TTestInput` leverages the `BaseModel` from an external library to inherit basic model functionalities.
- It utilizes the `Field` class to define attributes related to the input samples, although the specific fields are not detailed in the provided context.
- The class employs the `field_validator` to enforce validation rules, specifically checking that the provided samples are not identical. If the validation fails, it raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the input does not meet the necessary criteria for conducting an independent t-test.
- The class is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the application, ensuring that any data passed to it adheres to the expected format and validation rules.
