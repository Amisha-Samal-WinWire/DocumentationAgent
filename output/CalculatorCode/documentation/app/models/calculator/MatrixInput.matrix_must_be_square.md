### MatrixInput.matrix_must_be_square() -> None

**Description:**
The `matrix_must_be_square` method is responsible for validating that a given matrix is square, meaning it has the same number of rows and columns. This validation is crucial in mathematical computations where square matrices are required, such as in certain linear algebra operations.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects a matrix-like structure (e.g., a list of lists) as input, which should be provided through the context in which this method is called. The matrix should be a two-dimensional array where each sub-array represents a row.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to enforce the validation rule.
- It first checks the length of the input matrix to determine the number of rows.
- It then iterates through each row of the matrix to ensure that the number of columns (i.e., the length of each row) matches the number of rows.
- If any row does not have the same length as the total number of rows, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the matrix is not square.
- This method ensures that any matrix processed by the application meets the necessary criteria for further mathematical operations, thereby preventing potential errors in calculations.
