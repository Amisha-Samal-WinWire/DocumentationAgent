### CorrelationInput.check_min_columns() -> None

**Description:**
The `check_min_columns` method is responsible for validating that a given input meets the minimum column requirements necessary for correlation calculations. It ensures that the data structure provided contains an adequate number of columns to perform the intended statistical operations.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects an input data structure (such as a DataFrame) that is being validated for the minimum number of columns. The specific requirements for this input are not detailed in the method itself but are implied to be related to the context of correlation analysis.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Instead, it raises an exception if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to perform its validation checks. This validator is likely designed to enforce specific constraints on the input data.
- If the input does not meet the minimum column requirement, the method raises a `ValueError`, which is also sourced from an external library. This exception serves to inform the user that the input data is insufficient for the intended operation.
- The method is likely called as part of a larger validation process within the `CorrelationInput` class, ensuring that any subsequent operations that depend on the input data can proceed without errors related to insufficient data structure.
