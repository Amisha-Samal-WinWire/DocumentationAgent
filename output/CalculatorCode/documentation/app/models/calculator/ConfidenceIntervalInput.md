### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class serves as a model for calculating confidence intervals in statistical analysis. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to define and compute confidence intervals based on provided data inputs.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not have any explicitly defined parameters or attributes mentioned in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle inputs related to statistical data necessary for calculating confidence intervals. This may include sample means, standard deviations, sample sizes, and confidence levels. Specific constraints or formats for these inputs are not detailed in the provided context.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return a value; rather, it is designed to facilitate the calculation of confidence intervals through its methods and attributes.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class likely extends the functionality of the `BaseModel` from an external library, inheriting its properties and methods. This inheritance suggests that `ConfidenceIntervalInput` may utilize base model features for data validation, serialization, or other model-related functionalities.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic required for confidence interval calculations, which typically involves statistical formulas that take into account the mean, standard deviation, and sample size to determine the range within which a population parameter is expected to lie with a certain level of confidence.
- While the specific methods and internal workings of the class are not detailed in the provided context, it can be inferred that the class will include methods for setting input values, validating them, and performing the necessary calculations to derive confidence intervals based on the statistical principles involved.
