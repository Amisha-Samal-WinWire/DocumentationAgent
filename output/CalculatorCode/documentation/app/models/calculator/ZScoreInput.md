### ZScoreInput

**Description:**
The `ZScoreInput` class is designed to facilitate the calculation of z-scores, which are statistical measures that describe a value's relation to the mean of a group of values. This class extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, allowing for structured input and processing of data necessary for z-score calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the z-scores will be calculated. This attribute is essential for the class's functionality as it serves as the primary input for statistical analysis.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` attribute should be a list of floating-point numbers. It is expected that this list contains valid numerical values, and it should not be empty, as an empty list would not allow for meaningful statistical calculations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value directly. Instead, it provides methods to compute and retrieve z-scores based on the input data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, the `ZScoreInput` class initializes its attributes, particularly the `data` attribute, which stores the input values.
- The class likely includes methods to compute the mean and standard deviation of the input data, which are necessary for calculating z-scores.
- The z-score for each value in the `data` list is computed using the formula: \( z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \), where \( X \) is the value, \( \mu \) is the mean of the data, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.
- The class may also provide additional methods for data validation and error handling to ensure that the input meets the required criteria for statistical analysis.
- The interaction with the `BaseModel` suggests that `ZScoreInput` may inherit or utilize methods from this base class, enhancing its capabilities for data management and processing.
