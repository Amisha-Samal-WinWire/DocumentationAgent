### StdDevInput

**Description:**
The `StdDevInput` class serves as a model for calculating the standard deviation of a dataset. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to perform this statistical computation, leveraging the capabilities of its parent class, `BaseModel`.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `StdDevInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.

**Expected Input:**
- The class is designed to work with a dataset, typically represented as a list of numerical values. The input data should be valid and suitable for statistical analysis, meaning it should contain numeric types (e.g., integers or floats) and should not be empty.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class itself does not return a value directly. Instead, it provides methods (inherited from `BaseModel`) that can be used to compute the standard deviation based on the input data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `StdDevInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for data handling and processing.
- The class is expected to include methods for calculating the standard deviation, although these methods are not explicitly detailed in the provided information.
- The standard deviation calculation typically involves computing the mean of the dataset, followed by determining the variance (the average of the squared differences from the mean), and finally taking the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation.
- The interaction with the `BaseModel` may include data validation, storage, and possibly additional statistical methods that enhance the functionality of the `StdDevInput` class.
