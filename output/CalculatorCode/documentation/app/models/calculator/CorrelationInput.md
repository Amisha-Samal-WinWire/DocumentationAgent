### CorrelationInput

**Description:**
The `CorrelationInput` class serves as a model for managing a correlation matrix. It ensures that at least two columns are provided when specified, thereby enforcing a fundamental requirement for correlation calculations. This class is designed to facilitate the validation and handling of input data necessary for correlation analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any parameters or attributes explicitly in the provided context.

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects input data that consists of multiple columns, typically in the form of a data structure (like a DataFrame) that can be validated for correlation analysis. At least two columns must be provided to perform meaningful correlation calculations. If the input does not meet this requirement, a validation error will be raised.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return any value upon instantiation but may raise exceptions if the input validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CorrelationInput` class inherits from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for model validation and data handling.
- It utilizes the `field_validator` from an external library to enforce validation rules on the input data. This validator checks that the input meets the specified criteria, particularly ensuring that at least two columns are present.
- If the validation fails, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the input does not conform to the required specifications for correlation analysis.
- The class is structured to integrate seamlessly with other components of the application, allowing for robust data validation and error handling in the context of correlation matrix calculations.
