# File Summary

# FILE-LEVEL Documentation for Statistical Input Models

### üìå Basic Information
- **Title & Overview**: 
  This file contains a collection of model classes designed for various statistical calculations, including confidence intervals, correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and more. Each class encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods to handle input data, perform validations, and facilitate computations relevant to their respective statistical functions.

- **Purpose**: 
  The primary purpose of this file is to provide structured input models that ensure data integrity and facilitate statistical analyses. Each model is tailored to specific statistical operations, ensuring that input data adheres to required formats and constraints.

- **Scope**: 
  This documentation covers the classes and methods defined within the file, including `ConfidenceIntervalInput`, `CorrelationInput`, `DescriptiveStatsInput`, `DualInput`, `FutureValueInput`, `ListInput`, `LoanPaymentInput`, `MatrixInput`, `PresentValueInput`, `RegressionInput`, `SingleInput`, `StdDevInput`, `TTestInput`, and `ZScoreInput`. Each class is designed to handle specific types of statistical input and validation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical or Functional Details
- **Architecture / Design**: 
  The classes inherit from a base model class, `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionalities such as data validation and serialization. Each specific input class extends this base functionality to cater to its unique requirements.

- **Features & Functions**: 
  - **ConfidenceIntervalInput**: Models inputs for calculating confidence intervals.
  - **CorrelationInput**: Validates and manages input for correlation analysis.
  - **DescriptiveStatsInput**: Facilitates the calculation of descriptive statistics.
  - **DualInput**: Handles operations requiring two numerical inputs.
  - **FutureValueInput**: Models inputs for future value calculations in finance.
  - **ListInput**: Manages a list of numerical values for statistical computations.
  - **LoanPaymentInput**: Encapsulates input parameters for loan payment calculations.
  - **MatrixInput**: Validates and manages matrix data for mathematical operations.
  - **PresentValueInput**: Models inputs for present value calculations in finance.
  - **RegressionInput**: Ensures distinctness of variables for regression analysis.
  - **SingleInput**: Handles operations requiring a single numerical input.
  - **StdDevInput**: Models inputs for calculating standard deviation.
  - **TTestInput**: Validates input samples for independent t-tests.
  - **ZScoreInput**: Facilitates the calculation of z-scores.

- **Requirements**: 
  Each class expects specific input formats, such as lists of numerical values, floats, or integers. They also utilize external libraries for validation and data handling, although specific dependencies are not detailed in the provided context.

### üöÄ Setup and Usage
- **Installation Instructions**: 
  There are no specific installation instructions provided in the documentation snippets. However, it is implied that the file is part of a larger application that may require relevant libraries for statistical computations.

- **Configuration Settings**: 
  No configuration settings are explicitly mentioned in the documentation. Each class is designed to validate its input upon instantiation.

- **Usage Guidelines**: 
  To use the features in this file, instantiate the relevant input class with the required parameters. Each class will perform validation checks on the provided data. For example:
  - Create an instance of `FutureValueInput` by providing `initial_investment`, `interest_rate`, and `years`.
  - Use `CorrelationInput` to ensure that the input data contains at least two columns for correlation analysis.
  - Call methods on the instantiated objects to perform calculations or retrieve processed data as needed.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the statistical input models defined in the file, detailing their purpose, functionality, and usage.
