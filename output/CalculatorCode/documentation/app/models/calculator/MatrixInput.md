### MatrixInput

**Description:**
`MatrixInput` is a class designed to facilitate matrix operations within the application. It serves as a model that incorporates various validators to ensure the integrity of matrix data and includes a helper function for additional functionality related to matrix manipulation.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `matrix` (`np.array`): A NumPy array representing the matrix data. This attribute is validated to ensure it meets specific criteria for matrix operations.
  - Additional attributes may include validation flags or configuration settings, but specific details are not provided in the current context.

**Expected Input:**
- The `matrix` attribute is expected to be a NumPy array. The input should conform to the requirements of a valid matrix, which typically includes:
  - Non-empty arrays.
  - Consistent row lengths (for 2D matrices).
  - Appropriate data types (e.g., numeric types for mathematical operations).

**Returns:**
- The class does not have a return value in the traditional sense, as it is a model class. However, it provides methods that may return processed matrix data or validation results based on the operations performed.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `MatrixInput` class extends from `BaseModel`, which likely provides foundational functionality for data modeling and validation.
- It utilizes the `Field` and `field_validator` from an external library to define and enforce constraints on the `matrix` attribute. This ensures that any matrix assigned to the class instance adheres to the specified validation rules.
- The class may include methods that leverage NumPy's array operations to perform calculations or transformations on the matrix data, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.
- The overall design promotes data integrity and facilitates matrix operations, making it a crucial component for applications that require mathematical computations involving matrices.
