# File Summary

# FILE-LEVEL Documentation for Statistics API Module

### üìå Basic Information
- **Title & Overview**: 
  This module, located at `app/api/v1/endpoints/statistics.py`, serves as a central point for defining and managing API endpoints related to statistical operations. It utilizes the `APIRouter` from the FastAPI framework to facilitate the creation and organization of these endpoints.

- **Purpose**: 
  The purpose of this module is to provide a structured interface for performing various statistical analyses and calculations, including but not limited to future value calculations, loan payments, present value calculations, standard deviation, confidence intervals, correlation matrices, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.

- **Scope**: 
  The module encompasses a range of statistical functions and endpoints that can be accessed via HTTP requests, enabling users to perform complex statistical operations through a simple API interface.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical or Functional Details
- **Architecture / Design**: 
  The module is designed using the FastAPI framework, which allows for the creation of RESTful APIs. It employs an `APIRouter` to manage routes efficiently, ensuring that the API remains modular and maintainable as new statistical functionalities are added.

- **Features & Functions**:
  - **calculate_future_value**: Computes the future value of an investment based on interest rate, number of periods, periodic payment, and present value.
  - **calculate_loan_payment**: Calculates the periodic payment required to repay a loan.
  - **calculate_present_value**: Determines the present value of an investment based on future cash flows.
  - **calculate_std_deviation**: Computes the standard deviation of a list of numerical values.
  - **get_confidence_interval**: Calculates the confidence interval for a given dataset.
  - **get_correlation_matrix**: Computes the Pearson correlation matrix for specified columns in a database.
  - **get_descriptive_stats**: Handles requests for calculating descriptive statistics.
  - **get_z_scores**: Computes Z-scores for a given dataset.
  - **perform_regression**: Executes Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis.
  - **perform_ttest**: Conducts an independent two-sample t-test to compare means.

- **Requirements**:
  - The module requires a valid SQLite database for certain functions (e.g., `get_correlation_matrix`, `perform_regression`).
  - It relies on external libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for statistical calculations.
  - The input data for various functions must be validated to ensure they meet the expected formats and types.

### üöÄ Setup and Usage
- **Installation Instructions**: 
  Ensure that the FastAPI framework and necessary dependencies (such as NumPy and SciPy) are installed in your Python environment. This can typically be done using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi numpy scipy
  ```

- **Configuration Settings**: 
  No specific configuration settings are detailed in the provided documentation. However, ensure that the database path is correctly set for functions that require database access.

- **Usage Guidelines**: 
  - Each function can be accessed via its corresponding API endpoint, which should be defined in the module.
  - Input data must be formatted correctly as specified in the documentation for each function.
  - Proper error handling is implemented to return structured feedback in case of invalid inputs or calculation failures.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the statistics API module, outlining its purpose, features, and usage instructions for effective integration and utilization in applications requiring statistical analysis.
