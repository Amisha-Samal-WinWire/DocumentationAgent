### get_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_descriptive_stats` function is designed to handle HTTP POST requests for calculating descriptive statistics based on a list of numerical data provided by the client. It processes the input data, invokes a service to compute the statistics, and returns the results in a structured JSON format. This function is part of an API endpoint that facilitates statistical analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers representing the dataset for which descriptive statistics are to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a list of numerical values (floats). The list must not be empty; otherwise, an error will be raised. Each number in the list should be a valid float, and the list can contain any number of elements.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, which may include values such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, depending on the implementation of the underlying statistics service.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by extracting the input data from the request body, ensuring it is in the expected format.
- It then calls the `calculate_descriptive_stats` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the extracted data to compute the required statistics.
- If the input data is valid and the calculation is successful, the function formats the results into a JSON response.
- In case of errors (such as invalid input or calculation failures), the function raises an `APIException` with an appropriate status code and error message, ensuring that clients receive structured error information.
- This function leverages external libraries for routing and dependency injection, facilitating its integration into the broader API framework.
