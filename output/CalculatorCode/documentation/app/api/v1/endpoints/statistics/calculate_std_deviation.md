### calculate_std_deviation(data: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. This function is essential for statistical analysis, providing a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list containing numerical values. The list must not be empty, as the standard deviation cannot be computed for an empty dataset. The values should ideally be of the same type (either all integers or all floats) to ensure accurate calculations.

**Returns:**
`float`: The calculated standard deviation of the input list, representing the dispersion of the data points from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `np.std` method from the NumPy library to compute the standard deviation. This method calculates the standard deviation by determining the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- The result is then converted to a float to ensure that the return type is consistent, even if the input list contains integer values.
- This function does not handle exceptions or errors related to invalid input types or empty lists; it is assumed that the input will be validated before calling this function.
