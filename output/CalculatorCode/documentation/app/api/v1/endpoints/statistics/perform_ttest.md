### perform_ttest(samples1: List[float], samples2: List[float]) -> Dict[str, float]

**Description:**
The `perform_ttest` function executes an independent two-sample t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent samples. It leverages the `perform_independent_ttest` method from the `StatsService` class to perform the statistical analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `samples1` (`List[float]`): The first sample of numerical data, which can be a list or a numpy array.
- `samples2` (`List[float]`): The second sample of numerical data, which can also be a list or a numpy array.

**Expected Input:**
- Both `samples1` and `samples2` should be lists or numpy arrays containing numerical values (floats or integers).
- The samples should not be empty, and they should ideally represent independent observations.

**Returns:**
`Dict[str, float]`: A dictionary containing the results of the t-test, specifically:
- `t_statistic`: The calculated t-statistic value.
- `p_value`: The associated p-value indicating the probability of observing the data given that the null hypothesis is true.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the input samples to ensure they are in the correct format (lists or numpy arrays).
- It then calls the `perform_independent_ttest` method from the `StatsService` class, passing the two samples as arguments.
- The `perform_independent_ttest` method computes the t-statistic and p-value using the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module, which performs the independent t-test.
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the t-statistic and p-value, which can be used to assess the significance of the difference between the two sample means. 

This function is designed to be used within an API context, where it may be called in response to a POST request, and it may raise an `APIException` if any errors occur during processing.
