### get_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence: float) -> dict

**Description:**
The `get_confidence_interval` function calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical data. It utilizes statistical methods to determine the range within which the true population mean is likely to fall, based on the provided confidence level. This function is particularly useful in statistical analysis and reporting, where understanding the variability and reliability of data is crucial.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers representing the sample data for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence` (`float`): A floating-point number between 0 and 1 representing the desired confidence level for the interval (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The list must contain numerical values to perform statistical calculations.
- `confidence` must be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will not yield valid confidence intervals.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys:
- `'mean'`: The mean of the input data as a float.
- `'confidence_level'`: The confidence level used for the calculation as a float.
- `'interval'`: A list containing two floats that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by calculating the number of data points (`n`) in the input list.
- It computes the mean of the data using the `numpy.mean` function.
- The standard error of the mean (SEM) is calculated using the `scipy.stats.sem` function, which provides a measure of how much the sample mean is expected to vary from the true population mean.
- The margin of error is determined by multiplying the SEM by the critical value from the t-distribution, which is obtained using `scipy.stats.t.ppf`. This critical value is based on the specified confidence level and the degrees of freedom (n - 1).
- Finally, the function returns a dictionary containing the calculated mean, the confidence level, and the computed confidence interval, which is represented as a list of the lower and upper bounds. 

This function is essential for statistical analysis, providing insights into the reliability of sample estimates and aiding in decision-making processes based on data.
