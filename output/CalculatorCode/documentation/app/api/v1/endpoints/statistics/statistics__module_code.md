### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central point for defining and managing the API endpoints related to statistical operations within the application. It utilizes the `APIRouter` from an external library to facilitate the creation and organization of these endpoints, allowing for structured and maintainable API development.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of `APIRouter`, which is a component of the FastAPI framework designed to handle routing for API endpoints.
- This module is likely to define various statistical endpoints that can be accessed via HTTP requests, although specific endpoints are not detailed in this documentation.
- The use of `APIRouter` allows for modular organization of routes, enabling the application to scale and maintain a clean architecture as more statistical functionalities are added.
- The module may include decorators to define the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for each endpoint, along with the corresponding handler functions that will process incoming requests and return appropriate responses. 

Overall, `module_code` is essential for setting up the foundational structure for the API's statistical features, ensuring that the endpoints are well-organized and easily accessible.
