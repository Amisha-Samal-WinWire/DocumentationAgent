### perform_regression(db_path: str, table_name: str, dependent_var: str, independent_vars: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]

**Description:**
The `perform_regression` function executes an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis on a specified dataset. It retrieves data from a database table, performs the regression using the specified dependent and independent variables, and returns a summary of the regression results, including coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the database from which data will be loaded.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table in the database that contains the data for the regression analysis.
- `dependent_var` (`str`): The name of the dependent variable (the outcome variable) for which predictions are to be made.
- `independent_vars` (`List[str]`): A list of names of independent variables (predictors) that will be used in the regression model.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to a database file.
- `table_name` should be a valid string corresponding to an existing table in the database.
- `dependent_var` must be a string that matches a column name in the specified table.
- `independent_vars` should be a list of strings, each representing a column name in the table that will serve as predictors. The list should not be empty and all specified columns must exist in the table.

**Returns:**
`Dict[str, Any]`: A dictionary containing the results of the regression analysis, which includes:
- `coefficients`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their corresponding coefficients.
- `standard_errors`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their standard errors.
- `t_statistics`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their t-statistics.
- `p_values`: A dictionary mapping variable names to their p-values.
- `r_squared`: A float representing the R-squared value of the regression model.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by loading the relevant data from the specified database table using the `_load_data` method, which retrieves the dependent and independent variables.
- It constructs the design matrix `X` by stacking a column of ones (for the intercept) with the values of the independent variables.
- The function then uses NumPy's least squares method to compute the regression coefficients and residuals.
- It calculates various statistics, including the mean squared error (MSE), standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values for each coefficient.
- The R-squared value is computed to assess the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.
- Finally, the function compiles all the results into a summary dictionary and returns it. 

This function relies on the `perform_ols_regression` method from the `StatsService` class to perform the actual regression calculations, ensuring that the regression analysis is executed efficiently and accurately.
