### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central point for defining and organizing API routes within the application. It utilizes the `APIRouter` from an external library to facilitate the creation of modular and maintainable API endpoints, allowing for better separation of concerns and easier integration of various components of the application.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of `APIRouter`, which is a utility provided by an external library designed to handle routing for APIs.
- It likely includes the use of `include_router`, another external library function, to incorporate additional routers or endpoints into the main application router. This allows for a hierarchical structure of routes, where different modules can define their own routes and be included in the main API seamlessly.
- The logic within `module_code` is expected to focus on setting up the routing structure, defining any necessary middleware, and possibly configuring route prefixes or tags for better organization and documentation of the API endpoints.
- Overall, this module acts as a foundational building block for the API, ensuring that routes are properly registered and can be accessed by clients in a structured manner.
