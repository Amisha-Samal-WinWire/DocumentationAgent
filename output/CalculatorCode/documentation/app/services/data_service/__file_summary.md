# File Summary

# FILE-LEVEL Documentation for `data_service.py`

### üìå Basic Information
- **Title & Overview**: 
  The `data_service.py` module contains the `DataService` class, which is responsible for managing data operations within the application. It provides methods to load data from various sources, including SQLite databases and CSV files, and formats this data into pandas DataFrames and Series for further analysis.

- **Purpose**: 
  The primary purpose of this module is to facilitate efficient data retrieval and processing, ensuring that data is accessible and correctly structured for use in data-driven applications.

- **Scope**: 
  This module encompasses functionalities for:
  - Connecting to SQLite databases and retrieving entire tables or specific columns.
  - Reading CSV files and extracting specified columns as pandas Series.
  - Ensuring robust error handling and resource management during data operations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical or Functional Details
- **Architecture / Design**: 
  The `DataService` class is designed to interact with external libraries such as `pandas` and `sqlite3`. It encapsulates methods that manage connections to data sources, execute queries, and handle data formatting.

- **Features & Functions**:
  - `get_dataframe_from_sqlite()`: Connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame.
  - `get_series_from_file(file: Any, column_name: str)`: Reads a CSV file and extracts a specified column as a pandas Series.
  - `get_series_from_sqlite(db_path: str, table_name: str, column_name: str)`: Retrieves a specific column from a designated SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series.

- **Requirements**:
  - Dependencies: The module relies on the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `sqlite3` library for database interactions.
  - Data Inputs: 
    - For `get_dataframe_from_sqlite()`: Requires access to a SQLite database file and an existing table within that database.
    - For `get_series_from_file()`: Requires a valid file-like object representing a CSV file and a column name that exists in the CSV.
    - For `get_series_from_sqlite()`: Requires the file path to a SQLite database, the name of an existing table, and the name of an existing column.

### üöÄ Setup and Usage
- **Installation Instructions**: 
  Ensure that the required libraries are installed. You can install `pandas` using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

- **Configuration Settings**: 
  No specific configuration settings are required for the `DataService` class itself, but ensure that the paths to the SQLite database and CSV files are correctly specified when using the methods.

- **Usage Guidelines**:
  - To use the `DataService`, instantiate the class and call its methods with the appropriate parameters. For example:
    ```python
    from app.services.data_service import DataService

    data_service = DataService()
    
    # Retrieve a DataFrame from SQLite
    df = data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite()

    # Extract a Series from a CSV file
    series = data_service.get_series_from_file(file, 'column_name')

    # Get a Series from a specific column in a SQLite table
    series_from_db = data_service.get_series_from_sqlite('path/to/db.sqlite', 'table_name', 'column_name')
    ```
  - Ensure that error handling is implemented to manage exceptions such as `DataError` when data is not found or when there are issues with file reading or database connections.
