### DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite() -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**
This method connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table, returning it as a pandas DataFrame. It is designed to facilitate data access for other services, specifically `ValidationService` and `StatsService`, by providing a structured format for data manipulation and analysis.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects the SQLite database to be accessible and the specified table to exist within that database. There are no specific input parameters required for this method.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A pandas DataFrame containing all the records from the specified table in the SQLite database. If the table is empty, the DataFrame will reflect that with an empty structure.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`, which requires the database file path.
- It then executes a SQL query to select all records from a specified table using `pd.read_sql_query`. This function converts the SQL query results directly into a pandas DataFrame.
- After retrieving the data, the method checks if the DataFrame is empty using `df.empty`. If the DataFrame is empty, it may raise a `DataError` to indicate that no data was found.
- Finally, the method ensures that the database connection is properly closed using `conn.close`, regardless of whether the operation was successful or if an error occurred during data retrieval. This is crucial for resource management and preventing database locks.
