### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a part of the `data_service.py` module, which is responsible for managing data operations within the application. This module is designed to facilitate the interaction between the application and various data sources, ensuring that data is efficiently loaded, processed, and made available for analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This module does not require specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it may rely on methods from the `DataService` class that require parameters such as file paths or database connection details, which should be provided as strings.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` interacts with the `DataService` class, which provides methods for loading data into pandas DataFrames from different sources, including files and databases.
- It leverages the functionality of `DataService` to perform operations such as retrieving data from SQLite databases and ensuring that the data is correctly formatted for further analysis.
- The logic within this module is designed to handle various data retrieval scenarios, including error handling for cases where data sources may be unavailable or improperly formatted.
- The module ensures that any exceptions raised during data operations are managed effectively, maintaining data integrity and providing clear feedback for debugging purposes.
