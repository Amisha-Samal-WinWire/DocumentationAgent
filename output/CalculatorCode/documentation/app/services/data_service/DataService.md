### DataService

**Description:**
`DataService` is a service class designed for loading data into pandas DataFrames from various sources, including files and databases. It provides methods to facilitate the retrieval and processing of data, ensuring that it is correctly formatted and accessible for further analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The class does not require specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, methods within the class may require parameters such as file paths or database connection details, which should be provided as strings.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataService` class includes methods that interact with external libraries such as `pandas`, `sqlite3`, and `os.path`. 
- One of the key methods, `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`, connects to a SQLite database using a specified database path and retrieves an entire table as a pandas DataFrame. 
- It first checks if the database file exists at the given path, raising a `DataError` if it does not. 
- Upon establishing a connection, it executes a SQL query to select all records from the specified table. 
- If the resulting DataFrame is empty, it raises a `DataError` indicating that the table is either empty or does not exist. 
- Any exceptions encountered during the database operations are caught and re-raised as `DataError` instances, providing a clear message for debugging purposes. 
- The class is designed to ensure robust error handling and data integrity, making it suitable for use in data-driven applications.
