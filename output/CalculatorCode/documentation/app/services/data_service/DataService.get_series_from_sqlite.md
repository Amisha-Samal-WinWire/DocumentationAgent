# Documentation for DataService.get_series_from_sqlite

### DataService.get_series_from_sqlite(db_path: str, table_name: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
Retrieves a specific column from a designated SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is useful for extracting individual data series from a larger dataset stored in a SQLite database.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which the data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the SQLite database that contains the desired column.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to be extracted from the specified table.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `table_name` should be a string that corresponds to an existing table within the database.
- `column_name` should be a string that matches a column name in the specified table.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the values from the specified column of the table. If the column does not exist or if the table is empty, a `DataError` may be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method first establishes a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path`.
- It constructs a SQL query to select the specified column from the designated table.
- The query is executed, and the results are loaded into a pandas Series.
- If the specified column does not exist or if the table is empty, the method raises a `DataError`, which is a custom exception designed to handle data-related issues.
- The connection to the database is closed after the operation to ensure proper resource management.
