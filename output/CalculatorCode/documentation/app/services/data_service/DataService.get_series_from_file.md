### DataService.get_series_from_file(file: Any, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a CSV file, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series. This function is designed to facilitate data retrieval from CSV files, making it easier to work with specific data columns in a structured format.

**Parameters:**
- `file` (`Any`): The file object representing the CSV file to be read. This should be a file-like object that supports reading operations.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to extract from the CSV file. This should match one of the column headers in the CSV.

**Expected Input:**
- The `file` parameter should be a valid file-like object that can be read, such as one obtained from an upload or file system.
- The `column_name` should be a string that corresponds to an existing column in the CSV file. If the column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column of the CSV file. If the column is not found, a `DataError` will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by checking if the provided file has a valid CSV extension using the `file.filename.endswith` method.
- It then reads the content of the file using `file.file.read`, which retrieves the raw data.
- The raw data is decoded and passed to `pd.read_csv`, which parses the CSV content into a pandas DataFrame.
- The method checks if the specified `column_name` exists in the DataFrame's columns using `df.columns`.
- If the column exists, it extracts the data from that column using `df[column_name]` and returns it as a pandas Series.
- If any errors occur during this process, such as file reading issues or missing columns, a `DataError` is raised to handle the exceptions appropriately, ensuring robust error management.
