# Documentation for app\services\stats_service.py::module_code

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a foundational component within the `stats_service.py` file, which is part of the applicationâ€™s service layer dedicated to statistical analysis. This module is designed to facilitate the interaction with the `StatsService` class, enabling the retrieval and analysis of data from a SQLite database. It encapsulates the logic necessary for performing statistical computations and ensures that the data is appropriately managed and processed.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not directly accept input parameters; however, it is expected to work in conjunction with the `StatsService` class, which requires:
  - `db_path` (string): A valid path to an existing SQLite database file.
  - `table_name` (string): The name of a table within the database that contains the data for analysis.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` is primarily responsible for orchestrating the functionality of the `StatsService` class. It initializes the class with the necessary parameters (`db_path` and `table_name`) and manages the flow of data between the database and the statistical analysis functions.
- Upon instantiation of the `StatsService`, it establishes a connection to the SQLite database specified by `db_path`.
- The module ensures that the database file exists and that the specified table contains data. If these conditions are not met, appropriate errors are raised.
- The data retrieval process involves executing a SQL query to fetch all records from the specified table, which are then loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further statistical analysis.
- The module may also facilitate the invocation of various statistical methods provided by the `StatsService`, allowing for computations such as mean, standard deviation, and hypothesis testing, leveraging external libraries like NumPy and SciPy as needed. 

This module acts as a crucial link between the data storage layer and the statistical analysis layer, ensuring that data is accurately retrieved and processed for insights.
