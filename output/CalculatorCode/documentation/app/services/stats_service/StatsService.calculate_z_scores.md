### calculate_z_scores(numbers: list) -> list

**Description:**
Calculates the Z-Scores for a given list of numbers. Z-Scores indicate how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset, providing a way to understand the relative position of a value within a distribution.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values for which Z-Scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `numbers` should be a list containing numerical values (integers or floats). The list must not be empty, as Z-Scores cannot be computed without a mean and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`list`: A list of Z-Scores corresponding to the input numbers, where each Z-Score represents the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean of the input list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first converts the input list of numbers into a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations.
- It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the array using `np.mean` and `np.std`, respectively.
- Each Z-Score is computed by subtracting the mean from each number and then dividing by the standard deviation.
- The resulting Z-Scores are rounded to a suitable number of decimal places for clarity and returned as a list. 

This method leverages the capabilities of the NumPy library to perform statistical calculations efficiently, ensuring that the Z-Scores are computed accurately and quickly.
