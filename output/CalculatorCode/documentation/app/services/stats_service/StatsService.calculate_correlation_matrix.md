### calculate_correlation_matrix() -> dict

**Description:**
Calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for specified columns in a dataset using the DataService. This method leverages the capabilities of external libraries to analyze the relationships between different variables represented in the dataset.

**Parameters:**
- `None`

**Expected Input:**
- The method expects the dataset to be loaded through an internal method (`self._load_data`), which retrieves the data in a format compatible with correlation analysis. The dataset should contain numerical columns for which the correlation is to be calculated.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary representation of the Pearson correlation matrix, where the keys are the column names and the values are the corresponding correlation coefficients.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by invoking `self._load_data` to retrieve the dataset. This step ensures that the data is prepared and available for analysis.
- It then utilizes the `df.corr` function from an external library to compute the Pearson correlation coefficients among the specified numerical columns in the dataset. This function calculates the pairwise correlation of columns, excluding any non-numeric data.
- Finally, the resulting correlation matrix is converted to a dictionary format using the `to_dict` function, making it easier to work with and interpret the results in subsequent operations or analyses. 

This method is crucial for understanding the relationships between different variables in the dataset, providing insights that can inform further statistical analysis or decision-making processes.
