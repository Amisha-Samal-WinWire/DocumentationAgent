### StatsService

**Description:**
`StatsService` is a class designed to perform statistical analysis on data retrieved from a SQLite database. It utilizes various statistical methods and functions from external libraries, such as NumPy and SciPy, to compute metrics and perform tests on the data. The class is intended to facilitate the extraction, manipulation, and analysis of data, providing insights through statistical computations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the SQLite database that contains the data for analysis.
- `data_frame` (`pd.DataFrame`): A pandas DataFrame that holds the data retrieved from the specified table in the SQLite database.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `table_name` should be a valid string representing the name of a table within the database. The table must exist and should not be empty for successful data retrieval.

**Returns:**
`pd.DataFrame`: A pandas DataFrame containing the data from the specified table in the SQLite database. If the table is empty or does not exist, an error is raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The class begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path`.
- It checks for the existence of the database file; if the file does not exist, a `DataError` is raised.
- A SQL query is constructed to select all records from the specified `table_name`.
- The query is executed, and the results are loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
- After loading the data, the connection to the database is closed.
- If the resulting DataFrame is empty, a `DataError` is raised, indicating that the table is either empty or does not exist.
- The class leverages various statistical functions from external libraries (e.g., NumPy and SciPy) to perform calculations such as mean, standard deviation, correlation, and hypothesis testing on the data contained in the DataFrame. These functions are called as needed based on the specific statistical analysis being performed.
