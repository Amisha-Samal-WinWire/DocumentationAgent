### calculate_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence_level: float) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical data points. The confidence interval provides a range within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, based on the sample data and the specified confidence level.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): The desired confidence level for the interval, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence level).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats or integers. The list must contain at least two elements to calculate a meaningful confidence interval.
- `confidence_level` should be a float between 0 and 1, representing the confidence level. Values outside this range will lead to an error.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two floats that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first calculates the mean of the provided data using `np.mean`, which computes the average value.
- It then determines the standard error of the mean (SEM) using `st.sem`, which provides an estimate of the variability of the sample mean.
- The critical value for the confidence interval is obtained using `st.t.ppf`, which computes the t-distribution's percent point function based on the specified confidence level and the degrees of freedom (calculated as the length of the data minus one).
- Finally, the function computes the margin of error by multiplying the critical value by the standard error, and it constructs the confidence interval by subtracting and adding this margin from the mean.
- The resulting lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval are returned as a tuple.
