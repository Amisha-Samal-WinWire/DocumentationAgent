### StatsService.perform_ols_regression() -> dict

**Description:**
The `perform_ols_regression` method performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using NumPy's least squares functionality. It calculates the regression coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values for the regression model, returning a summary dictionary containing these statistics.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method relies on data loaded through the `self._load_data` method, which is expected to provide the necessary input data for regression analysis. The input data should be structured appropriately, typically as a matrix of independent variables (features) and a vector of dependent variables (target).

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following keys and their corresponding values:
- `coefficients`: A list of regression coefficients for each independent variable.
- `intercept`: The intercept of the regression line.
- `r_squared`: The R-squared value indicating the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- `p_values`: A list of p-values associated with each coefficient, indicating the statistical significance of the predictors.

**Detailed Logic:**
1. **Data Loading**: The method begins by loading the necessary data using the `self._load_data` method, which retrieves the independent and dependent variables for the regression analysis.
2. **Matrix Preparation**: It constructs the design matrix `X` by stacking the independent variables and adding a column of ones to account for the intercept.
3. **Coefficient Calculation**: The method uses NumPy's `np.linalg.lstsq` function to compute the regression coefficients by solving the least squares problem.
4. **Predictions**: It calculates the predicted values by multiplying the design matrix `X` with the computed coefficients.
5. **Residuals and R-squared Calculation**: The residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) are computed, and the R-squared value is calculated to assess the model's fit.
6. **P-value Calculation**: The method computes the p-values for the coefficients using the t-distribution, which involves calculating the standard errors and leveraging the cumulative distribution function from the `stats` library.
7. **Summary Construction**: Finally, it constructs and returns a summary dictionary containing the coefficients, intercept, R-squared value, and p-values, providing a comprehensive overview of the regression analysis results.

This method is designed to be efficient and straightforward, leveraging NumPy's capabilities for numerical computations while avoiding the overhead of additional libraries like `statsmodels`.
