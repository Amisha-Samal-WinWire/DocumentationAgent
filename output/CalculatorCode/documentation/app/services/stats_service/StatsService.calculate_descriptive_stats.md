### StatsService.calculate_descriptive_stats(numbers: list) -> dict

**Description:**
Calculates descriptive statistics for a given list of numerical values. This method computes key statistical measures including the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, and returns them in a structured dictionary format.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the descriptive statistics will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numeric data. It can include integers and floats, and the list should not be empty. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return an incomplete result, depending on the implementation.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the following descriptive statistics:
- `mean`: The average of the numbers.
- `median`: The middle value when the numbers are sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the list.
- `variance`: A measure of how much the numbers vary from the mean.
- `standard_deviation`: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance of each number from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by utilizing the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library to calculate the mean of the input list.
- It then computes the median using `np.median`, which sorts the list and finds the middle value.
- The mode is determined using `stats.mode` from the SciPy library, which identifies the most frequently occurring value(s) in the list.
- Variance is calculated with `np.var`, which measures the average of the squared differences from the mean.
- Finally, the standard deviation is computed using `np.std`, providing insight into the dispersion of the dataset.
- All computed statistics are organized into a dictionary and returned, allowing easy access to each statistical measure.
