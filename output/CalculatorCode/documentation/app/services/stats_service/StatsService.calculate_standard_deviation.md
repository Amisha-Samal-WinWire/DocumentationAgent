### calculate_standard_deviation(numbers: list) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the standard deviation of a list of numerical values. The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, providing insight into the spread of the data points around the mean.

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing at least one numerical value. It can include both integers and floating-point numbers. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return a specific value (this should be verified in the implementation).

**Returns:**
`float`: The standard deviation of the provided list of numbers, representing the average distance of each number from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `np.std` method from the NumPy library to compute the standard deviation. This method calculates the standard deviation by first determining the mean of the input list.
- It then computes the squared differences between each number and the mean, averages these squared differences, and finally takes the square root of that average to yield the standard deviation.
- The function is designed to handle a variety of numerical inputs efficiently, leveraging the optimized performance of the NumPy library for numerical computations.
