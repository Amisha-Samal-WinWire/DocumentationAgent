# Documentation for app\services\financial_service.py::module_code

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a foundational component within the `financial_service.py` file, which is part of the `app.services` package. It is designed to encapsulate the core functionalities related to financial calculations, leveraging the capabilities of the `FinancialService` class. This module is integral for performing various financial analyses, such as calculating future values, present values, and payment amounts.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not have specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is expected that any functions or methods defined within this module will require numerical inputs that adhere to the following constraints:
  - Principal amounts must be non-negative floats.
  - Interest rates should be expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
  - Time periods must be positive integers.

**Returns:**
The module itself does not return any values. However, the functions or methods defined within it will return numerical values based on the financial calculations performed, typically in the form of floats representing monetary values.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` interacts with the `FinancialService` class, which utilizes the `numpy_financial` library to perform specialized financial calculations.
- Key functionalities provided by the `FinancialService` include:
  - **Future Value Calculation**: Computes the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.
  - **Present Value Calculation**: Determines the present value of a future sum of money or a stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.
  - **Payment Calculation**: Calculates the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan over a specified number of payments.
- Each method within the `FinancialService` class takes relevant parameters such as principal, interest rate, and number of periods, applying the corresponding financial formulas to return calculated values.
- The `module_code` is structured to provide a clean and accessible interface for users, allowing them to perform financial calculations without needing to directly interact with the underlying `numpy_financial` library. This abstraction enhances usability and ensures that the financial computations are straightforward and efficient.
