### FinancialService

**Description:**
`FinancialService` is a service class designed to facilitate common financial calculations, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library. It provides methods for calculating future value, present value, and payment amounts, which are essential for various financial analyses and decision-making processes.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The class does not have any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, the methods within the class will require numerical inputs such as principal amounts, interest rates, and time periods, which should adhere to the following constraints:
  - Principal amounts should be non-negative floats.
  - Interest rates should be expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
  - Time periods should be positive integers.

**Returns:**
The methods within the `FinancialService` class return various numerical values based on the financial calculations performed. The return types are typically floats representing monetary values, such as future value, present value, or periodic payments.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FinancialService` class utilizes the `numpy_financial` library, which provides specialized functions for financial calculations.
- Key methods within the class include:
  - **Future Value Calculation (`npf.fv`)**: This method computes the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.
  - **Present Value Calculation (`npf.pv`)**: This method determines the present value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.
  - **Payment Calculation (`npf.pmt`)**: This method calculates the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan over a specified number of payments.
- Each method takes relevant parameters such as principal, interest rate, and number of periods, and applies the corresponding financial formula to return the calculated value.
- The class is structured to provide a clean interface for performing these calculations, ensuring that users can easily access and utilize the financial functions without needing to directly interact with the underlying library.
