# ‚öôÔ∏è Technical or Functional Details

## Architecture / Design
The `financial_service.py` file is designed around the `FinancialService` class, which encapsulates methods that utilize the `numpy_financial` library. The class structure allows for clear separation of functionalities, enabling users to perform financial calculations efficiently.

## Features & Functions
- **Future Value Calculation**: Computes the future value of an investment based on the principal, annual interest rate, and number of periods.
- **Present Value Calculation**: Determines the present value of a specified future sum of money based on the annual interest rate and number of periods.
- **Payment Calculation**: Calculates the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan over a specified number of payments.

## Requirements
- **Dependencies**: The `FinancialService` class relies on the `numpy_financial` library for performing financial calculations.
- **Data Inputs**: 
  - Principal amounts must be non-negative floats.
  - Interest rates should be expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
  - Time periods must be positive integers.

# üöÄ Setup and Usage

## Installation Instructions
To use the functionalities provided in this file, ensure that the `numpy_financial` library is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy-financial
```

## Configuration Settings
No specific configuration settings are required for the `FinancialService` class. However, users should ensure that the input parameters for the methods adhere to the expected constraints outlined in the documentation.

## Usage Guidelines
To utilize the features in this file, instantiate the `FinancialService` class and call the desired methods with appropriate parameters. Here‚Äôs a brief example of how to use the class:

```python
from app.services.financial_service import FinancialService

# Create an instance of FinancialService
financial_service = FinancialService()

# Calculate future value
future_value = financial_service.calculate_future_value(principal=1000, annual_rate=0.05, periods=10)

# Calculate payment
payment = financial_service.calculate_payment(principal=10000, annual_rate=0.05, num_payments=60)

# Calculate present value
present_value = financial_service.calculate_present_value(future_value=5000, annual_rate=0.05, num_periods=10)
```

This example demonstrates how to perform financial calculations using the methods provided in the `FinancialService` class. Each method will return a float value representing the calculated financial metric.
