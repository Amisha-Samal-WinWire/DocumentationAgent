### ValidationService

**Description:**
`ValidationService` is a class designed to perform complex, cross-service validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid against the actual data stored in the system. This service plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and consistency across different components of the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **data_svc** (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is used to retrieve data from various sources, including databases, for validation purposes.

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects to interact with various models and data structures that require validation. It is designed to handle input data that may come from user requests or other services, ensuring that the data adheres to the expected formats and logical constraints.

**Returns:**
- None: The class does not return values upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods that may return validation results or raise exceptions based on the validation logic.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ValidationService` class utilizes the `DataService` to fetch data from a SQLite database, specifically using the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method to retrieve tables as pandas DataFrames.
- It performs a series of validation checks on the data retrieved, ensuring that the input meets the necessary criteria for logical consistency and integrity.
- The class may raise custom exceptions, such as `DataError`, when validation fails or when issues arise during data retrieval, providing clear feedback for debugging and error handling.
- The validation logic encompasses checks for distinctness of input variables, ensuring that they do not violate statistical assumptions, particularly when preparing data for regression analysis or correlation calculations.
- Overall, the `ValidationService` acts as a mediator between the data layer and the application logic, ensuring that all data interactions are validated against the actual data context.
