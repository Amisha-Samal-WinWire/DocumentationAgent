### ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs(payload: RegressionInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_regression_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data for a regression analysis. It connects to a database to ensure that the specified columns exist and are of a numeric type, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data before proceeding with further analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data containing the columns to be validated for the regression analysis.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` should be an instance of the `RegressionInput` model, which must include the necessary fields that represent the columns intended for regression analysis. The fields should be defined in such a way that they can be validated against the database schema.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Instead, it performs validation checks and raises exceptions if any issues are found.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the relevant data from the database using the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method of the `DataService`. This method connects to a SQLite database and fetches the specified table as a pandas DataFrame.
- Once the DataFrame is obtained, the method checks for the existence of the columns specified in the `payload`. It verifies that these columns are present in the DataFrame.
- Following the existence check, the method further validates that the data types of the specified columns are numeric. This is crucial for regression analysis, which requires numeric inputs.
- If any of the validation checks fail (either due to missing columns or non-numeric data types), the method raises a `DataError` exception, providing a clear indication of the validation failure. This allows for effective error handling and debugging in scenarios where the input data does not meet the required criteria.
