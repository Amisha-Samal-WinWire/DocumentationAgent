# Documentation for ValidationService.__init__

### ValidationService.__init__()

**Description:**
Initializes the `ValidationService`, establishing a dependency on the `DataService`. This service is responsible for validating data inputs and ensuring that the data used within the application meets specified criteria before further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which provides methods for loading data into pandas objects from various sources, such as files and databases.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data_service` parameter must be an instance of the `DataService` class. This instance should be properly configured to connect to the necessary data sources (e.g., databases or file systems) that the `ValidationService` will utilize for validation tasks.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of the `ValidationService` class is called when an instance of the service is created. It accepts a `DataService` instance as a parameter.
- This method assigns the provided `DataService` instance to an internal attribute, allowing the `ValidationService` to leverage the data loading capabilities of `DataService` for its validation processes.
- The initialization process ensures that the `ValidationService` is ready to perform its tasks, relying on the functionality provided by the `DataService` to access and manipulate data as needed.
