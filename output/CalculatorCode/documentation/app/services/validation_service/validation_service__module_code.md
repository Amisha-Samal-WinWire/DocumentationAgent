# Documentation for app\services\validation_service.py::module_code

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a foundational component within the `validation_service.py` file, encapsulating the logic necessary for validating data across various services. It is integral to ensuring that the data processed by the application adheres to the required standards of integrity and consistency, leveraging the capabilities of the `ValidationService` class.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `module_code` is designed to work with data structures and models that require validation. It expects input data that may originate from user requests or other services, ensuring that this data conforms to predefined formats and logical constraints.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` interacts with the `ValidationService` class, which is responsible for executing complex validation checks on incoming data.
- It utilizes the `DataService` to retrieve necessary data from various sources, including a SQLite database, ensuring that the validation process is grounded in actual data context.
- The validation checks performed by the `ValidationService` include verifying the distinctness of input variables and ensuring compliance with statistical assumptions, particularly in scenarios involving regression analysis or correlation calculations.
- The module may raise custom exceptions, such as `DataError`, to signal validation failures or issues encountered during data retrieval, thereby facilitating effective error handling and debugging.
- Overall, the `module_code` acts as a critical intermediary, ensuring that all data interactions are validated against the actual data context, thereby upholding the application's data integrity and consistency.
