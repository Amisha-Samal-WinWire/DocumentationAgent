### ValidationService.validate_correlation_inputs(payload: CorrelationInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_correlation_inputs` method is responsible for validating the inputs required for performing correlation analysis. It ensures that the specified columns exist within the dataset and that these columns contain numeric data types. This validation is crucial for preventing errors during the correlation computation process.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the Pydantic model that encapsulates the input data for correlation analysis. This model typically includes the necessary attributes such as the names of the columns to be analyzed.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` must be an instance of `CorrelationInput`, which should contain valid column names that are expected to be present in the dataset. The columns specified in the payload must exist in the DataFrame retrieved from the database and must be of a numeric data type (e.g., integer or float).

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Instead, it raises an exception if the validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the dataset from a SQLite database using the `self.data_svc.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method. This method connects to the database, executes a query to fetch the relevant table, and returns the data as a pandas DataFrame.
- After obtaining the DataFrame, the method checks for the existence of the columns specified in the `payload`. If any of the required columns are missing, it raises a `DataError` indicating which columns are not found.
- Subsequently, the method verifies that each of the specified columns is numeric by utilizing the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function. If any column fails this check, a `DataError` is raised, specifying that the column must contain numeric data.
- Overall, this method ensures that the inputs for correlation analysis are valid, thereby preventing potential runtime errors during the analysis phase.
