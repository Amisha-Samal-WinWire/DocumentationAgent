# File Summary

# FILE-LEVEL Documentation Summary

### üìå Basic Information
- **Title & Overview**: 
  This file contains custom exception classes tailored for error handling within an API and data processing contexts. The primary classes defined are `APIException`, `CalculationError`, and `DataError`, each designed to encapsulate specific types of errors that may arise during application execution.

- **Purpose**: 
  The purpose of this file is to provide structured exception handling mechanisms that allow developers to manage errors gracefully, ensuring that meaningful messages and HTTP status codes are returned to clients or logged for debugging purposes.

- **Scope**: 
  The scope of this file includes defining custom exceptions that can be used throughout the application, particularly in scenarios involving API interactions and mathematical calculations. It aims to enhance error reporting and facilitate better debugging practices.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical or Functional Details
- **Architecture / Design**: 
  The file employs an object-oriented design, with each exception class inheriting from the base `Exception` class. This design allows for the creation of specialized exceptions that can carry additional context about the error encountered.

- **Features & Functions**:
  - **APIException**: A base exception for API-related errors, allowing for structured error messages and HTTP status codes.
  - **CalculationError**: A specific exception for handling errors that occur during mathematical calculations.
  - **DataError**: A dedicated exception for managing errors related to data processing.

- **Requirements**: 
  - Each exception class requires a message string that describes the error and, in the case of `APIException`, an HTTP status code. The status code must be a valid integer within the range of 100 to 599.

### üöÄ Setup and Usage
- **Installation Instructions**: 
  No specific installation instructions are provided, as this file is intended to be integrated into an existing application.

- **Configuration Settings**: 
  There are no configuration settings required for the exception classes themselves; however, users should ensure that the application logic is set up to catch and handle these exceptions appropriately.

- **Usage Guidelines**: 
  - To use these exception classes, instantiate them with a descriptive message and, for `APIException`, an appropriate HTTP status code. 
  - Example usage:
    ```python
    raise APIException("Resource not found", status_code=404)
    raise CalculationError("Division by zero")
    raise DataError("Invalid data format")
    ```
  - These exceptions can be caught in try-except blocks to provide feedback to users or to log the error for further analysis.
