### DataError

**Description:**
`DataError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling and debugging when data-related issues arise.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The class does not take any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is typically raised with an error message that describes the nature of the data error.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- When an instance of `DataError` is created, it calls the constructor of its superclass (presumably `Exception`) using `super().__init__`. This allows it to inherit the properties and methods of the base exception class.
- The primary purpose of this class is to provide a clear and distinct type of exception that can be raised and caught in scenarios where data integrity or processing issues occur, facilitating better error management and debugging in the application.
