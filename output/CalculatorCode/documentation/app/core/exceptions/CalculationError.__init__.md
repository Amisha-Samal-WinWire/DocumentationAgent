### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError.__init__` method initializes an instance of the `CalculationError` class, which is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur during mathematical calculations within the application. This method sets up the error message and any additional context needed for debugging.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: (`CalculationError`): The instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that explains the nature of the calculation error. This message is intended to provide clarity on what went wrong during the calculation process.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that succinctly describes the error encountered. It is expected that this string will provide enough context for developers or users to understand the issue without needing to delve into the code.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return a value. Instead, it initializes the instance of the `CalculationError` class with the provided message.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class (likely a built-in exception class) is executed, allowing the `CalculationError` to inherit standard exception behavior.
- The `message` parameter is then passed to the superclass's `__init__` method, which sets the error message for the exception. This message can later be retrieved when the exception is raised, providing insight into the specific calculation error that occurred.
- The method does not perform any additional logic or computations; its primary role is to facilitate the creation of a well-defined exception with a meaningful message.
