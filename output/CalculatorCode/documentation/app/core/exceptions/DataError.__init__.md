### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `DataError` class is a custom exception that is designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `DataError` class, allowing it to capture and store relevant error messages or additional information when an instance is created.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: (`DataError`): The instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A string that describes the error encountered. This message provides context about the specific data issue that triggered the exception.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that conveys the nature of the data error. It is expected to be informative enough to help the user or developer understand what went wrong. There are no strict constraints on the content of the message, but it should be meaningful and relevant to the data processing context.

**Returns:**
`None`: The `__init__` method does not return a value. Instead, it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of `DataError` calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class (likely a built-in exception class) is executed, which typically includes setting up the exception message.
- The `message` parameter is passed to the superclass's `__init__` method, allowing the base exception class to store the error message appropriately.
- This method serves as the foundation for creating a specialized exception that can be raised in scenarios where data-related errors occur, enhancing error handling in the application.
