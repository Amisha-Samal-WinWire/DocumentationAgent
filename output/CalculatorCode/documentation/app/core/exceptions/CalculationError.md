### CalculationError

**Description:**
`CalculationError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors that occur during mathematical calculations within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised in scenarios where a calculation cannot be completed successfully due to invalid inputs or other unforeseen issues.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (This class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from its superclass.)

**Expected Input:**
- This class is intended to be instantiated when a calculation error occurs. The input to the constructor is typically a message string that describes the nature of the error.

**Returns:**
None (This class does not return any value upon instantiation; it serves as an exception type.)

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `CalculationError` class inherits from the base exception class, utilizing the `super().__init__` method to initialize the exception with a message. This allows for the propagation of error messages that can provide context about the specific calculation issue encountered.
- When raised, this exception can be caught in a try-except block, allowing the application to handle calculation errors gracefully and provide feedback to the user or log the error for further analysis.
