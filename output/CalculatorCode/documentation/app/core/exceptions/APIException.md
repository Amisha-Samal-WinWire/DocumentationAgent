### APIException

**Description:**
`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within an API context. It facilitates the creation of structured JSON error messages, which can be returned to clients when exceptions occur. This class serves as a foundation for defining more specific exceptions that can be caught and processed by a custom exception handler in the main application logic.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the error (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).
- `detail` (`str`): A string providing a detailed message about the error, which can be used to inform the client about the nature of the problem.

**Expected Input:**
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically in the range of 100 to 599.
- `detail` should be a descriptive message that conveys the specifics of the error encountered.

**Returns:**
None (the constructor initializes the object).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `APIException` class by accepting a `status_code` and a `detail` message.
- It assigns the provided `status_code` and `detail` to the instance attributes for later access.
- The constructor of the base `Exception` class is called with the `detail` message, ensuring that the exception can be raised with a meaningful message when triggered.
- This class does not implement any additional methods or logic beyond what is necessary for initialization, but it sets the groundwork for more specific exceptions that can inherit from it.
