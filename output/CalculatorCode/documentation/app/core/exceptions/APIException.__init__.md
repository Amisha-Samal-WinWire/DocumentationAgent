### APIException.__init__(self, message: str, status_code: int)

**Description:**
The `APIException` class is designed to handle exceptions that occur within the API layer of the application. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `APIException` class, allowing for the specification of an error message and an associated HTTP status code. This enables consistent error handling and reporting throughout the API.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the exception. This message is intended to inform the user or developer about the nature of the error.
- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the error. This code is used to indicate the type of error that occurred (e.g., 404 for "Not Found", 500 for "Internal Server Error").

**Expected Input:**
- `message` should be a non-empty string that clearly describes the error encountered.
- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically an integer in the range of 100 to 599, representing various types of responses as defined by the HTTP specification.

**Returns:**
None: The method does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`, which ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the exception handling hierarchy.
- The method then assigns the provided `message` and `status_code` to the instance variables, allowing them to be accessed later when the exception is raised or logged.
- This setup allows the `APIException` to carry both a human-readable message and a machine-readable status code, facilitating better error management in API responses.
