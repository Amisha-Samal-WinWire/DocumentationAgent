# File Summary

# FILE-LEVEL Documentation for `app\core\config.py`

### üìå Basic Information
- **Title & Overview**: 
  - This file contains the `module_code` which serves as a configuration module for the application. It is responsible for managing and providing access to various configuration settings, primarily loaded from environment variables through the `Settings` class.

- **Purpose**: 
  - The purpose of this file is to facilitate the dynamic management of application configuration settings, ensuring that the application can adapt to different environments seamlessly.

- **Scope**: 
  - The scope of this module includes the initialization and management of configuration settings, leveraging environment variables to provide a flexible configuration approach for the application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical or Functional Details
- **Architecture / Design**: 
  - The `module_code` interacts with the `Settings` class, which is designed to manage application configuration settings. The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings` and may utilize the `Config` external library for enhanced configuration management.

- **Features & Functions**: 
  - The `module_code` does not define any parameters or attributes directly but relies on the `Settings` class to load and validate configuration values. It ensures that any changes to environment variables are dynamically reflected in the application settings.

- **Requirements**: 
  - The `module_code` and the `Settings` class require that the necessary environment variables be set prior to usage. These environment variables should correspond to the configuration settings required by the application.

### üöÄ Setup and Usage
- **Installation Instructions**: 
  - No specific installation instructions are provided in the documentation. However, ensure that the required external libraries (such as `Config`) are available in the application environment.

- **Configuration Settings**: 
  - The `module_code` and `Settings` class expect environment variables to be set prior to their usage. The absence of these variables may lead to default values being used or errors being raised.

- **Usage Guidelines**: 
  - To use the configuration settings, ensure that the necessary environment variables are defined. Upon initialization of the `Settings` class, configuration attributes can be accessed, which are populated based on the environment variables. The `module_code` will provide access to these settings, allowing the application to adapt to its environment effectively.
