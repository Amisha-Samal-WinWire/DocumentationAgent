### Settings

**Description:**
The `Settings` class is responsible for managing application configuration settings, which are primarily loaded from environment variables. This class serves as a centralized point for accessing configuration values throughout the application, ensuring that settings can be easily modified and accessed in a consistent manner.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon initialization. Instead, it relies on environment variables to populate its attributes.

**Expected Input:**
- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to its instantiation. These variables should correspond to the configuration settings required by the application. The absence of expected environment variables may lead to default values being used or errors being raised, depending on the implementation.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides access to various configuration attributes that can be retrieved after the class is initialized.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings`, which is part of an external library designed to facilitate the loading and validation of settings from various sources, including environment variables.
- Upon initialization, the class automatically reads the relevant environment variables and populates its attributes accordingly.
- The class may also utilize the `Config` external library to manage configuration settings, providing additional functionality such as validation, type conversion, and default values.
- The logic within the `Settings` class ensures that any changes to the environment variables are reflected in the application settings, promoting a dynamic configuration management approach.
