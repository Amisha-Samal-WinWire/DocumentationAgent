### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a configuration module within the application, responsible for managing and providing access to various configuration settings. It leverages the `Settings` class to load and validate configuration values primarily from environment variables, ensuring that the application can adapt to different environments seamlessly.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not define any parameters or attributes directly. It relies on the `Settings` class for configuration management.

**Expected Input:**
- The `module_code` expects that the necessary environment variables are set prior to its usage. These environment variables should correspond to the configuration settings required by the application. If the expected environment variables are missing, the application may revert to default values or raise errors, depending on the implementation of the `Settings` class.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not return a value. Instead, it provides access to the configuration settings through the `Settings` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` interacts with the `Settings` class, which is designed to manage application configuration settings by reading from environment variables.
- Upon initialization, the `Settings` class automatically retrieves the relevant environment variables and populates its attributes, which can then be accessed by the `module_code`.
- The `Settings` class may also utilize the `Config` external library to enhance configuration management, offering features such as validation, type conversion, and default values.
- The logic ensures that any changes to the environment variables are dynamically reflected in the application settings, promoting a flexible and responsive configuration management approach.
