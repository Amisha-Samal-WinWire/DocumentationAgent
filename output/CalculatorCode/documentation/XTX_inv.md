# Documentation for `XTX_inv`

### XTX_inv

**Description:**
`XTX_inv` is a function designed to compute the inverse of the matrix product \(X^T X\), where \(X\) is typically a data matrix used in statistical modeling or machine learning contexts. The function is essential for tasks such as linear regression, where the inverse of this matrix is required to derive coefficients.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`numpy.ndarray`): A two-dimensional array representing the data matrix. Each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a feature.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` should be a two-dimensional NumPy array with a shape of (m, n), where `m` is the number of observations and `n` is the number of features. It is expected that `m` is greater than or equal to `n` to ensure that the matrix \(X^T X\) is square and potentially invertible. The data should be numeric, and the matrix should ideally be of full rank to avoid singularity issues during inversion.

**Returns:**
`numpy.ndarray`: The function returns the inverse of the matrix \(X^T X\) as a two-dimensional NumPy array. If the matrix is singular and cannot be inverted, the function may raise an error or return a specific value indicating failure.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by calculating the transpose of the input matrix \(X\).
- It then computes the product of \(X^T\) and \(X\) to form the square matrix \(X^T X\).
- Following this, the function checks if the resulting matrix is invertible. This is typically done by evaluating its determinant or using a numerical method to assess its rank.
- If the matrix is invertible, the function proceeds to calculate its inverse using an appropriate numerical method, such as Gaussian elimination or leveraging built-in functions from libraries like NumPy.
- The final result is returned as the output, which can be used in further calculations, such as determining regression coefficients in linear models.
