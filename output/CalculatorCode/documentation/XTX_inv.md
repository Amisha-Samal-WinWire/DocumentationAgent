# Documentation for `XTX_inv`

### XTX_inv

**Description:**
`XTX_inv` is a function designed to compute the inverse of the matrix product of a given matrix \( X \) with its transpose \( X^T \). This operation is commonly used in statistical analysis and machine learning, particularly in linear regression and other multivariate techniques, where the inversion of such matrices is required for parameter estimation.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`ndarray`): A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the input matrix. It is expected to have more rows than columns (i.e., more observations than features).

**Expected Input:**
- The input matrix `X` should be a NumPy array with the shape (m, n), where \( m \) is the number of observations and \( n \) is the number of features. It is essential that \( m \) is greater than \( n \) to ensure that the matrix \( X^T X \) is invertible. Additionally, the matrix should not contain any singularities (i.e., it should not be rank-deficient).

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: The function returns the inverse of the matrix product \( (X^T X)^{-1} \) as a two-dimensional NumPy array. This matrix is used in various statistical computations, including the calculation of regression coefficients.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by calculating the matrix product of \( X^T \) (the transpose of matrix \( X \)) and \( X \) itself.
- It then checks if the resulting matrix \( X^T X \) is invertible. If it is not invertible (i.e., if it is singular), the function may raise an error or return a specific value indicating failure.
- Upon confirming that the matrix is invertible, the function computes the inverse using a suitable numerical method, such as Gaussian elimination or leveraging NumPy's built-in functions for matrix inversion.
- The final output is the computed inverse matrix, which can be utilized in further statistical analyses or modeling tasks. 

This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided input matrix.
