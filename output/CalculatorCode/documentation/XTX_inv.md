# Documentation for `XTX_inv`

### XTX_inv

**Description:**
`XTX_inv` is a function designed to compute the inverse of the matrix product \( X^T X \), where \( X \) is a given matrix. This operation is commonly used in statistical analysis and machine learning, particularly in the context of linear regression and other multivariate techniques. The function efficiently calculates the inverse of the resulting matrix, which is essential for solving systems of linear equations or optimizing certain algorithms.

**Parameters:**
- `X` (`numpy.ndarray`): A two-dimensional array representing the input matrix for which the inverse of the product \( X^T X \) is to be computed.

**Expected Input:**
- `X` should be a two-dimensional `numpy` array (matrix) with shape `(m, n)`, where \( m \) is the number of observations (rows) and \( n \) is the number of variables (columns).
- The matrix \( X \) must have full column rank, meaning that its columns must be linearly independent to ensure that \( X^T X \) is invertible.

**Returns:**
`numpy.ndarray`: The function returns a two-dimensional array that represents the inverse of the matrix product \( X^T X \). The shape of the returned array will be `(n, n)`, where \( n \) is the number of columns in the input matrix \( X \).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by computing the transpose of the input matrix \( X \).
- It then calculates the product \( X^T X \).
- After obtaining the product matrix, the function checks if the matrix is invertible. If it is, it proceeds to compute the inverse using an appropriate numerical method, such as Gaussian elimination or leveraging built-in functions from libraries like `numpy`.
- The resulting inverse matrix is returned for further use in statistical computations or machine learning algorithms.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies and relies solely on the capabilities of the `numpy` library for matrix operations.
