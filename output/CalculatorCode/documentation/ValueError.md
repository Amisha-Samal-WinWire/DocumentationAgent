# Documentation for `ValueError`

### ValueError

**Description:**
`ValueError` is an exception class that is raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but an inappropriate value. This exception is part of the built-in exceptions in Python and is commonly used to indicate that the input value does not meet the expected criteria for processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- `ValueError` is typically raised when a function or operation receives an argument that is of the correct type but has an invalid value. For example, passing a negative number to a function that expects a positive integer or providing a string that cannot be converted to a float.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When a `ValueError` is raised, it interrupts the normal flow of the program and signals to the caller that an invalid value has been encountered.
- The exception can be caught using a try-except block, allowing the program to handle the error gracefully rather than terminating abruptly.
- The message associated with the `ValueError` can provide additional context about what went wrong, helping developers diagnose issues in their code.
- This exception does not have any internal dependencies and is part of the core Python language, making it universally available across all Python programs.
