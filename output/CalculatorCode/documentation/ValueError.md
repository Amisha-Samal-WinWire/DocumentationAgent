# Documentation for `ValueError`

### ValueError

**Description:**
`ValueError` is an exception class in Python that is raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but an inappropriate value. This exception is part of the built-in exceptions in Python and is commonly used to indicate that a function's input does not meet the expected criteria, even though the type of the input is correct.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (as `ValueError` is an exception class and does not have parameters in the traditional sense).

**Expected Input:**
- `ValueError` is typically raised when a function or operation receives an argument that is of the correct type but has an invalid value. For example, passing a negative number to a function that expects a positive integer.

**Returns:**
None (as an exception, `ValueError` does not return a value; it interrupts the normal flow of the program).

**Detailed Logic:**
- When a function encounters an argument that is of the correct type but has an inappropriate value, it raises a `ValueError`. This is often used in data validation scenarios where the input must conform to specific rules.
- The exception can be caught using a try-except block, allowing the program to handle the error gracefully rather than crashing.
- The `ValueError` class can also be subclassed to create custom exceptions that provide more specific error messages or behaviors related to particular use cases.
- This exception does not have any internal dependencies and is part of Python's built-in exception hierarchy, making it widely applicable across various modules and functions.
