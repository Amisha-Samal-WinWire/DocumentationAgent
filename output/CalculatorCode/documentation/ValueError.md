# Documentation for `ValueError`

### ValueError

**Description:**
`ValueError` is an exception class in Python that is raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but an inappropriate value. This exception is part of the built-in exceptions in Python and is commonly used to indicate that the input value does not meet the expected criteria for processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (as `ValueError` is an exception class and does not have parameters in the traditional sense).

**Expected Input:**
- The `ValueError` is raised when a function or operation receives an argument that is of the correct type but has a value that is not acceptable or valid. For example, passing a string that cannot be converted to an integer or a negative number where only positive numbers are allowed.

**Returns:**
None (as an exception, `ValueError` does not return a value; it interrupts the normal flow of the program).

**Detailed Logic:**
- When a function encounters an argument that is of the correct type but has an invalid value, it raises a `ValueError` to signal that the input cannot be processed as intended.
- The exception can be caught using a try-except block, allowing the programmer to handle the error gracefully.
- This exception does not depend on any internal dependencies and is part of the core Python exception hierarchy, making it widely applicable across various functions and modules.
