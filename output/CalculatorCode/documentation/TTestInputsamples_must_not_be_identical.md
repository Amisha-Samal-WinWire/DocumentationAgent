# Documentation for `TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical`

### TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical() -> None

**Description:**
The `samples_must_not_be_identical` method is designed to validate that the samples provided to a test input are not identical. This is crucial in scenarios where distinct samples are necessary for accurate testing and analysis, ensuring that the integrity of the test results is maintained.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on the internal state of the `TTestInput` class, which is expected to contain a collection of samples. These samples should be provided in a manner that allows the method to assess their uniqueness. The specific structure or type of the samples is determined by the implementation of the `TTestInput` class.

**Returns:**
None: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises a `ValueError` if the validation fails, indicating that the samples are identical.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the samples from the internal state of the `TTestInput` instance.
- It then checks if all samples are identical by comparing them against each other.
- If the samples are found to be identical, the method raises a `ValueError`, signaling that the input does not meet the required criteria for distinct samples.
- This validation is essential to prevent erroneous test results that could arise from using non-unique samples.
- The method relies on the `ValueError` exception to communicate validation failures, which can be caught and handled by the calling code to ensure robust error management.
