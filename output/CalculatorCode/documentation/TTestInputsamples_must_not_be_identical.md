# Documentation for `TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical`

### TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical() -> None

**Description:**
The `samples_must_not_be_identical` method is designed to validate that the samples provided for a statistical test are not identical. This is crucial for ensuring the integrity of statistical analyses, as identical samples can lead to misleading results. The method utilizes the `field_validator` function to enforce this validation rule.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on the context of the `TTestInput` class, which is expected to contain sample data. The samples should be provided in a format that allows for comparison (e.g., lists or arrays).
- The method assumes that the samples have already been defined within the class instance.

**Returns:**
None: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises a `ValueError` if the validation fails, indicating that the samples are identical.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the samples from the class instance.
- It then checks if the samples are identical using a comparison operation.
- If the samples are found to be identical, the method raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message, signaling that the input is invalid for statistical testing.
- This validation is essential for maintaining the integrity of the statistical analysis process, as identical samples do not provide meaningful information for tests such as the t-test.
- The method relies on the `field_validator` function to perform the validation checks, ensuring that the samples meet the necessary criteria before proceeding with any further analysis.
