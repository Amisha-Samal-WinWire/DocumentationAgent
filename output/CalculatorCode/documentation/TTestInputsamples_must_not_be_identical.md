# Documentation for `TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical`

### TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical() -> None

**Description:**
The `samples_must_not_be_identical` method is designed to validate that the samples provided to a test input are not identical. This is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the test data, as identical samples can lead to misleading results and affect the validity of any analyses performed on the data.

**Parameters:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on the internal state of the `TTestInput` class, which is expected to contain a collection of samples. These samples should be of a type that allows for comparison (e.g., lists, arrays).
- It is assumed that the samples have been previously defined and are accessible within the context of the method.

**Returns:**
None. The method raises a `ValueError` if the samples are found to be identical.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the samples from the internal state of the `TTestInput` instance.
- It then checks if all samples are identical by comparing them against each other.
- If the samples are found to be identical, the method raises a `ValueError`, indicating that the samples must not be identical for valid testing.
- This validation helps maintain the integrity of the testing process by ensuring that the input data is varied enough to produce meaningful results.
- The method relies on the `field_validator` function to enforce this validation, ensuring that the samples meet the necessary criteria before any further processing occurs.
