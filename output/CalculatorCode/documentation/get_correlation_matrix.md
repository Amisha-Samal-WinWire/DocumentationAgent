### get_correlation_matrix(db_path: str, table_name: str, columns: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]

**Description:**
The `get_correlation_matrix` function computes the Pearson correlation matrix for specified numeric columns within a given database table. It first validates the input parameters to ensure that the specified columns exist and are numeric, and then it calculates the correlation matrix using the validated data.

**Parameters:**
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table in the database that contains the data for correlation analysis.
- `columns` (`List[str]`): A list of column names for which the correlation matrix will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `table_name` should be a valid string representing the name of a table within the database.
- `columns` should be a list of strings, each representing the name of a column in the specified table. At least two numeric columns must be provided for correlation analysis.

**Returns:**
`Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]`: A dictionary representing the Pearson correlation matrix, where the keys are the column names and the values are dictionaries mapping each column to its correlation coefficients with other specified columns.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters using the `validate_correlation_inputs` method from the `ValidationService`. This ensures that the specified columns exist in the table and are of numeric type.
- If the validation is successful, the function then calls the `calculate_correlation_matrix` method from the `StatsService`. This method retrieves the relevant data from the database and computes the Pearson correlation matrix.
- The resulting correlation matrix is formatted as a dictionary, where each key corresponds to a column name and the associated value is another dictionary containing correlation coefficients with other columns.
- If any validation errors occur during the input validation phase, an `APIException` is raised, providing a structured error response to the client.

### get_correlation_matrix() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**
The `get_correlation_matrix` function is designed to compute the correlation matrix for a given dataset. It serves as an endpoint in the API that facilitates the analysis of relationships between multiple variables by quantifying how they are related to one another. This function integrates input validation and correlation calculation, ensuring that the data provided is suitable for analysis before proceeding with the computation.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list` or `array-like`): The dataset for which the correlation matrix is to be calculated. It should be structured as a two-dimensional array or DataFrame, where each column represents a different variable and each row represents an observation.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter must be a two-dimensional structure containing numerical values. Each column should correspond to a variable, and all columns must have the same number of rows (observations). The dataset should not contain any missing values or non-numeric entries, as these would lead to errors during the correlation calculation.

**Returns:**
`np.ndarray`: A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the correlation coefficients between the variables in the dataset. Each element in the matrix indicates the correlation between a pair of variables, with values ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by utilizing the `validator.validate_correlation_inputs` to validate the input dataset. This step ensures that the data meets the necessary criteria for correlation analysis, including checks for non-empty datasets, equal lengths of input arrays, and numeric values.
- If the validation passes, the function then calls `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix`, which computes the correlation matrix based on the validated dataset. This function leverages statistical methods to determine the correlation coefficients, typically using Pearson's correlation.
- The resulting correlation matrix is then returned as a NumPy array, providing a structured representation of the relationships between the variables in the dataset.
- In the event of validation failure or any other errors during processing, the function raises an `APIException`, ensuring that errors are handled gracefully and informative messages are returned to the API client.
