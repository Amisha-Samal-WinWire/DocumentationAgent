# Documentation for `get_correlation_matrix`

### get_correlation_matrix() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**
The `get_correlation_matrix` function is responsible for retrieving and calculating the correlation matrix for a given dataset. This matrix quantifies the linear relationships between different variables, serving as a vital tool in statistical analysis and data exploration. The function ensures that the input data is validated before performing the correlation calculation, thereby preventing errors and ensuring the integrity of the results.

**Parameters:**
- `None`

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset in a suitable format, typically a two-dimensional array or DataFrame, where:
  - Rows represent individual observations.
  - Columns represent different variables, each containing numerical data.
- The dataset must not contain any missing values, as this could lead to inaccurate correlation calculations.

**Returns:**
`np.ndarray`: A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the correlation matrix. Each element (i, j) in the matrix indicates the correlation coefficient between variable i and variable j, with values ranging from -1 to 1:
- 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation,
- -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation,
- 0 indicates no correlation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by utilizing the `validator.validate_correlation_inputs` function to validate the input dataset, ensuring it meets the necessary criteria for correlation analysis.
- Upon successful validation, it calls the `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix` function to compute the correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables in the dataset.
- The resulting correlation coefficients are organized into a square matrix format, which corresponds to the number of variables present in the dataset.
- Finally, the function returns the computed correlation matrix, which can be used for further analysis or visualization. This function leverages dependency injection through `Depends`, allowing for flexibility and testability within the application.
