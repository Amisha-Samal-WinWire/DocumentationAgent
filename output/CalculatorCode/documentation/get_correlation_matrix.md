# Documentation for `get_correlation_matrix`

### get_correlation_matrix() -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `get_correlation_matrix` function is responsible for retrieving and calculating the correlation matrix for a specified dataset. This matrix quantifies the relationships between different variables, providing insights into how they are interrelated. The function integrates input validation and correlation computation, ensuring that the data is suitable for analysis before proceeding with the calculation.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`list` or `array-like`): The dataset for which the correlation matrix is to be calculated. This should be a two-dimensional collection where rows represent observations and columns represent variables.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter must be a two-dimensional array or DataFrame containing numerical values. Each column should represent a different variable, and all columns must be of the same length.
- The dataset should not contain any missing values, as these can lead to inaccurate correlation results.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the correlation coefficients between each pair of variables in the dataset. Each element in the matrix indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, with values ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by utilizing the `Depends` function to manage dependencies, ensuring that necessary components are available for execution.
- It then calls `validator.validate_correlation_inputs` to validate the input dataset. This validation checks that the data is non-empty, of appropriate dimensions, and contains only numerical values.
- If the validation passes, the function proceeds to invoke `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix`, which computes the correlation coefficients for the provided dataset.
- The resulting correlation matrix is then returned, allowing for further analysis or visualization in data science applications.
- If any validation errors occur, the function raises an `APIException`, providing structured error messages to facilitate debugging and user feedback. 

This structured approach ensures that the function operates reliably and produces accurate results, making it a vital component for statistical analysis within the application.
