### ValidationService

**Description:**
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex, cross-service validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid against the actual data stored in the system. This service plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and consistency across the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **Attributes:**
  - `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, used to retrieve data from various sources, such as databases, to facilitate validation processes.
  
**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` class does not take specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it relies on the methods of the `DataService` to fetch data, which requires valid database paths and table names as input when performing validations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. It initializes an object that can be used for performing validations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ValidationService` utilizes the `DataService` to access data from a SQLite database, leveraging its method `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` to retrieve data tables as pandas DataFrames.
- It performs various validation checks on the data, ensuring that the input adheres to the expected formats and logical constraints defined by the application’s business rules.
- The service may interact with other classes, such as `RegressionInput` and `CorrelationInput`, to validate the structure and integrity of the data being processed for regression analysis or correlation computations.
- Error handling is a key aspect of the validation process, with the service raising custom exceptions (like `DataError`) when it encounters issues related to data integrity or validation failures.
- The overall goal of the `ValidationService` is to ensure that all data interactions within the application are valid and reliable, thereby preventing potential errors downstream in the data processing pipeline.

### ValidationService

**Description:**
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It integrates with various models and the data layer to ensure that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid according to the actual data present in the system. This service is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that operations on the data are valid and meaningful.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is used to load data from various sources into Pandas DataFrames for validation purposes.
- `regression_input` (`RegressionInput`): An instance of the `RegressionInput` class, which is used to validate input variables for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis.
- `correlation_input` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the `CorrelationInput` class, which is used to validate the structure of correlation matrices.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` class expects instances of `DataService`, `RegressionInput`, and `CorrelationInput` to be provided upon initialization. These instances should be properly configured to ensure that the validation processes can be executed effectively.
- The data being validated should conform to the structures defined by the `RegressionInput` and `CorrelationInput` classes, ensuring that the necessary conditions for regression and correlation analysis are met.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation. Its primary purpose is to provide validation functionalities that can be invoked through its methods.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ValidationService` class initializes with instances of its dependencies, allowing it to leverage their functionalities for validation tasks.
- It utilizes the `DataService` to load data into DataFrames, which are then used for performing various validation checks.
- The class implements methods that validate the input for regression and correlation analyses, ensuring that the inputs meet the necessary criteria (e.g., distinct variables for regression, minimum column requirements for correlation).
- If validation fails, appropriate exceptions (such as `ValueError`) may be raised to inform the user of the specific issues encountered.
- The overall design emphasizes a modular approach, allowing the `ValidationService` to interact seamlessly with other components of the application, ensuring that data integrity is maintained throughout the validation process.
