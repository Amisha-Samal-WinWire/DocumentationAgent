# Documentation for `ValidationService`

### ValidationService

**Description:**
`ValidationService` is a service class dedicated to performing complex, cross-service validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid against the actual data present in the system. This service plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and consistency across the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **data_svc** (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is utilized for loading data from various sources into Pandas DataFrames. This service is essential for the validation processes that require access to actual data.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` expects to interact with valid data structures, particularly Pandas DataFrames, which are populated with data retrieved through the `DataService`. The input data should be structured in a way that allows for effective validation against business rules and logical constraints.

**Returns:**
- `None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods that perform validation checks and may raise exceptions if validation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon instantiation, `ValidationService` initializes its attributes, particularly the `data_svc` attribute, which is an instance of `DataService`. This setup allows the validation service to access and manipulate data as needed.
- The class likely contains multiple methods that implement various validation rules, which may involve querying the data layer through `data_svc` to retrieve relevant datasets for comparison.
- Validation checks may include ensuring that input data adheres to specific business rules, checking for data integrity, and confirming that relationships between different data entities are logically sound.
- If any validation checks fail, the service may raise a `DataError` exception, providing feedback on the nature of the validation failure. This error handling mechanism is crucial for maintaining robust data processing workflows.
- Overall, `ValidationService` acts as a gatekeeper for data integrity, ensuring that only valid data is processed and utilized within the application, thereby preventing potential issues that could arise from invalid or inconsistent data.
