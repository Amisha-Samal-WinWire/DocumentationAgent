# Documentation for `ValidationService`

### ValidationService

**Description:**
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It integrates with various models and the data layer to ensure that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid according to the actual data present in the system. This service is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that operations on the data are valid and meaningful.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is used to load data from various sources into Pandas DataFrames for validation purposes.
- `regression_input` (`RegressionInput`): An instance of the `RegressionInput` class, which is used to validate input variables for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis.
- `correlation_input` (`CorrelationInput`): An instance of the `CorrelationInput` class, which is used to validate the structure of correlation matrices.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` class expects instances of `DataService`, `RegressionInput`, and `CorrelationInput` to be provided upon initialization. These instances should be properly configured to ensure that the validation processes can be executed effectively.
- The data being validated should conform to the structures defined by the `RegressionInput` and `CorrelationInput` classes, ensuring that the necessary conditions for regression and correlation analysis are met.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation. Its primary purpose is to provide validation functionalities that can be invoked through its methods.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ValidationService` class initializes with instances of its dependencies, allowing it to leverage their functionalities for validation tasks.
- It utilizes the `DataService` to load data into DataFrames, which are then used for performing various validation checks.
- The class implements methods that validate the input for regression and correlation analyses, ensuring that the inputs meet the necessary criteria (e.g., distinct variables for regression, minimum column requirements for correlation).
- If validation fails, appropriate exceptions (such as `ValueError`) may be raised to inform the user of the specific issues encountered.
- The overall design emphasizes a modular approach, allowing the `ValidationService` to interact seamlessly with other components of the application, ensuring that data integrity is maintained throughout the validation process.
