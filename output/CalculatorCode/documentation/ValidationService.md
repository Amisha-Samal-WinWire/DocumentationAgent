# Documentation for `ValidationService`

### ValidationService

**Description:**
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex validations that extend beyond simple checks of model fields. It integrates with the data layer to ensure that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid when compared against the actual data stored in the system. This service is particularly useful for validating data integrity across multiple services and models.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is responsible for loading data from various sources into Pandas DataFrames. This service is utilized by `ValidationService` to access and validate data against the existing records.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ValidationService` expects an instance of `DataService` to be provided during initialization. This instance should be properly configured to connect to the relevant data sources (e.g., SQLite database or CSV files) from which data will be validated.

**Returns:**
None: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; instead, it provides methods for performing validations.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `ValidationService` class accepts a `DataService` instance, which it stores for later use.
- The class includes methods that perform various types of validations, leveraging the functionality of the `DataService` to retrieve data as needed.
- For each validation method, the service may query the data source to check for conditions such as the existence of records, the uniqueness of values, or the consistency of relationships between different data entities.
- The validation logic typically involves using Pandas DataFrames to manipulate and analyze the data retrieved from the `DataService`, allowing for efficient and powerful data validation operations.
- If any validation checks fail, appropriate exceptions (such as `DataError`) may be raised to signal issues with the data integrity, ensuring that the application can handle these errors gracefully.
