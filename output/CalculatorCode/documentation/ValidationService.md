### ValidationService

**Description:**  
The `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid against the actual data stored in the database. This service is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors during data processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class that the `ValidationService` relies on for data operations during validation tasks.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `data_service` parameter must be a properly initialized instance of the `DataService` class. This instance should be capable of executing the necessary data-related operations that the `ValidationService` will utilize for its validation processes.

**Returns:**  
None: The class does not return a value upon initialization.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `__init__` method of the `ValidationService` class accepts a `DataService` instance as a parameter, establishing a dependency that allows the `ValidationService` to perform data validations.
- This method does not execute any validation or processing; instead, it prepares the `ValidationService` for use by storing the provided `DataService` instance as an attribute for future access.
- The `ValidationService` includes methods such as `validate_regression_inputs` and `validate_correlation_inputs`, which are responsible for validating input data for regression and correlation analyses, respectively.
- Each of these validation methods interacts with the `DataService` to check for the existence of specified columns in the database and to ensure that these columns contain numeric data types.
- If any validation checks fail, the methods raise a `DataError`, providing descriptive messages that indicate the nature of the validation failure. This ensures that only valid data is processed, thereby enhancing the reliability of subsequent analyses.
