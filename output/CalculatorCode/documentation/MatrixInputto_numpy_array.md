# Documentation for `MatrixInput.to_numpy_array`

### MatrixInput.to_numpy_array() -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `to_numpy_array` method of the `MatrixInput` class converts the internal representation of matrix data into a NumPy array. This method facilitates efficient numerical computations by leveraging the capabilities of the NumPy library, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis of matrix data.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method does not require any parameters to be passed during invocation. It operates on the internal state of the `MatrixInput` instance, which should contain data structured in a way that can be converted into a NumPy array (e.g., lists or tuples).

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A NumPy array representing the matrix data stored within the `MatrixInput` instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method accesses the internal data structure of the `MatrixInput` instance, which is expected to be an array-like format (e.g., a list of lists).
- It utilizes the `np.array` function to convert this internal data into a NumPy array. The conversion process may involve specifying the data type and copy behavior, although these are typically inferred based on the internal data.
- The resulting NumPy array is optimized for performance and can be used for further numerical operations, such as matrix arithmetic, statistical analysis, or other mathematical computations within the NumPy ecosystem.
