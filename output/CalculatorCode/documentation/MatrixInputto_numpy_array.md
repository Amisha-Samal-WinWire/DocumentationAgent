# Documentation for `MatrixInput.to_numpy_array`

### MatrixInput.to_numpy_array() -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `to_numpy_array` method of the `MatrixInput` class converts the internal representation of matrix data into a NumPy array. This transformation allows for efficient numerical computations and manipulations using the powerful features of the NumPy library.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on the internal state of the `MatrixInput` instance, which is expected to contain data structured in a way that can be converted into a NumPy array. The specific structure of this data is determined by the implementation of the `MatrixInput` class.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A NumPy array representing the matrix data contained within the `MatrixInput` instance. The array is formatted according to the specifications of the NumPy `np.array` function, which may include considerations for data type and dimensionality.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method retrieves the internal matrix data from the `MatrixInput` instance.
- It then calls the `np.array` function to convert this data into a NumPy array. During this process, it may specify parameters such as `dtype`, `copy`, and `ndmin` based on the characteristics of the internal data.
- The resulting NumPy array is returned, enabling further numerical operations and analyses to be performed efficiently. The method leverages the capabilities of NumPy to handle various data types and structures, ensuring that the output is optimized for mathematical computations.
