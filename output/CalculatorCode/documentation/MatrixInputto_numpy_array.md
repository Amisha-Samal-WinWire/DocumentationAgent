# Documentation for `MatrixInput.to_numpy_array`

### MatrixInput.to_numpy_array() -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `to_numpy_array` method of the `MatrixInput` class is responsible for converting the internal representation of matrix data into a NumPy array. This transformation facilitates efficient numerical computations and data manipulations by leveraging the capabilities of the NumPy library.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on the internal state of the `MatrixInput` instance, which should contain valid array-like data (e.g., lists or tuples) that can be converted into a NumPy array. The specific structure of this data is determined by the implementation of the `MatrixInput` class.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A NumPy array object that represents the matrix data contained within the `MatrixInput` instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method retrieves the matrix data stored within the `MatrixInput` instance.
- It then calls the `np.array` function to convert this data into a NumPy array. During this conversion, the method may utilize parameters such as `dtype`, `copy`, and `order` to control the data type, memory layout, and whether to create a new copy of the data.
- The resulting NumPy array is returned, enabling further numerical operations and analyses to be performed on the matrix data. This method is essential for integrating the matrix data with NumPy's powerful array manipulation capabilities.
