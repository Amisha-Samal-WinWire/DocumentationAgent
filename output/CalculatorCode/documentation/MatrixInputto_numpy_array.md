### MatrixInput.to_numpy_array() -> np.ndarray

**Description:**  
Converts the internal representation of a matrix within the `MatrixInput` class to a NumPy array format. This method facilitates the transition from the class's data structure to a format that is widely used in numerical computations and data analysis.

**Parameters:**  
None

**Expected Input:**  
- The method operates on an instance of the `MatrixInput` class, which should contain a valid matrix representation. The internal structure of this matrix should be compatible with conversion to a NumPy array (e.g., it should be a list of lists or a similar iterable structure).

**Returns:**  
`np.ndarray`: A NumPy array representing the matrix contained within the `MatrixInput` instance.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method accesses the internal matrix data stored in the `MatrixInput` instance.
- It then utilizes NumPy's array conversion capabilities to transform this data into a NumPy array format.
- This conversion allows for enhanced performance and functionality, enabling the use of NumPy's extensive library of mathematical functions and operations on the resulting array.
- The method does not perform any error handling or validation of the internal matrix structure, assuming that the data is correctly formatted for conversion.
