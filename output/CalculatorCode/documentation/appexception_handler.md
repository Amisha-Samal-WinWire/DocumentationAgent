# Documentation for `app.exception_handler`

### app.exception_handler

**Description:**
The `app.exception_handler` is a designated external function responsible for managing exceptions that occur within the application. Its primary role is to intercept errors, log relevant information, and provide a standardized response to the user or calling process. This function enhances the robustness of the application by ensuring that exceptions are handled gracefully, thereby preventing crashes and improving user experience.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to handle exceptions of various types that may arise during the execution of the application. It does not take any direct input parameters but operates on exceptions that are raised within the application context.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function is invoked automatically when an exception is raised in the application. It captures the exception details, which may include the type of exception, the message, and the stack trace.
- The exception handler typically logs this information to a specified logging system or output, allowing developers to diagnose issues later.
- Depending on the application's design, it may also format a user-friendly error message to be displayed to the user, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies, meaning it operates independently within the external module, relying solely on the exception handling mechanisms provided by the programming language or framework in use.
