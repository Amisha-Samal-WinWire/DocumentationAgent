# Documentation for `app.exception_handler`

### app.exception_handler

**Description:**
The `app.exception_handler` is a function designed to manage and respond to exceptions that occur within the application. Its primary role is to provide a centralized mechanism for error handling, ensuring that exceptions are logged appropriately and that users receive meaningful feedback when errors occur.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to handle exceptions that are raised during the execution of the application. It does not take any direct input parameters but is invoked automatically when an exception occurs.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `app.exception_handler` is triggered whenever an unhandled exception is raised in the application. 
- Upon invocation, it captures the exception details, which may include the type of exception, the message, and the stack trace.
- The function typically logs this information to a logging system or console for debugging purposes.
- Additionally, it may format a user-friendly error message that is displayed to the end-user, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.
- The handler may also implement specific logic to differentiate between types of exceptions, allowing for tailored responses based on the nature of the error (e.g., handling validation errors differently from system errors).
- This function does not rely on any internal dependencies, making it a standalone component for error management within the application.
