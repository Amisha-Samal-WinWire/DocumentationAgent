# Documentation for `app.exception_handler`

### app.exception_handler

**Description:**
The `app.exception_handler` is an external function designed to manage and handle exceptions that may occur within the application. Its primary purpose is to provide a centralized mechanism for logging errors, returning appropriate responses, and ensuring that the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations without crashing.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function is expected to handle exceptions that arise during the execution of the application. It does not take any direct input parameters; instead, it operates on exceptions that are raised in the application context.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `app.exception_handler` is invoked whenever an exception is raised in the application. It captures the exception details, which may include the type of exception, the error message, and the stack trace.
- The function typically logs the exception information to a logging system or console for debugging purposes.
- It may also format a user-friendly error message to be returned to the client or user, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.
- Depending on the application's architecture, the function might interact with other components, such as middleware or response handlers, to manage the flow of control after an exception occurs.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies, making it a standalone component focused solely on exception management.
