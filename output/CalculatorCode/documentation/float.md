# Documentation for `float`

### float

**Description:**
The `float` function is a built-in Python function that converts a specified value into a floating-point number. This function is commonly used to ensure that numeric values are represented as decimals, allowing for more precise calculations, especially in scenarios involving division or when dealing with fractional values.

**Parameters:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `float` function can accept a variety of input types, including:
  - A string representation of a number (e.g., "3.14").
  - An integer (e.g., 5).
  - Another float (e.g., 2.71).
  - Special values like `inf` (infinity) and `nan` (not a number).
- The input must be convertible to a float; otherwise, a `ValueError` will be raised.

**Returns:**
`float`: The function returns a floating-point number that represents the converted value of the input.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `float` function first checks the type of the input value.
- If the input is a string, it attempts to parse the string into a floating-point number. This includes handling decimal points and scientific notation.
- If the input is an integer or another float, it simply converts it to a float without any additional processing.
- If the input is not convertible (e.g., a non-numeric string), the function raises a `ValueError`.
- The function does not interact with any external modules or dependencies, relying solely on Python's built-in capabilities for type conversion and error handling.
