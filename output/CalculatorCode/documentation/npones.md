# Documentation for `np.ones`

### np.ones(shape, dtype=None)

**Description:**
The `np.ones` function creates a new array filled with ones. It is a part of the NumPy library, which is widely used for numerical computations in Python. This function is particularly useful for initializing arrays where a default value of one is required, such as in matrix operations or when setting up data structures for machine learning algorithms.

**Parameters:**
- `shape` (`tuple` or `int`): Specifies the dimensions of the new array. If a single integer is provided, a 1-D array of that length is created. If a tuple is provided, it defines the shape of a multi-dimensional array.
- `dtype` (`data-type`, optional): The desired data type for the array. If not specified, the default data type is `float64`. This parameter allows users to create arrays of different types, such as integers or booleans.

**Expected Input:**
- `shape` must be a positive integer or a tuple of positive integers, indicating the size of each dimension of the array.
- `dtype` can be any valid NumPy data type (e.g., `np.int32`, `np.float64`, etc.), but it is optional.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: A new NumPy array of the specified shape, filled with ones. The data type of the array is determined by the `dtype` parameter or defaults to `float64` if not provided.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first validates the `shape` parameter to ensure it is either an integer or a tuple of integers.
- It then initializes a new array of the specified shape using the NumPy library's internal array creation mechanisms.
- If the `dtype` parameter is provided, it ensures that the new array is created with the specified data type; otherwise, it defaults to `float64`.
- The resulting array is filled with ones, which is achieved through efficient memory allocation and initialization techniques provided by NumPy.
- This function does not depend on any internal dependencies and leverages NumPy's optimized routines for array creation and manipulation.
