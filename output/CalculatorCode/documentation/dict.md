# Documentation for `dict`

### dict

**Description:**
The `dict` class in Python is a built-in data structure that provides a way to store key-value pairs. It allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of items based on unique keys. The `dict` class is mutable, meaning that its contents can be changed after creation, and it is unordered, which means that the items do not maintain any specific order.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the `dict` class does not take parameters upon instantiation, but can be initialized with key-value pairs).

**Expected Input:**
- The `dict` can be initialized with an optional iterable of key-value pairs (e.g., a list of tuples) or with keyword arguments. 
- Keys must be immutable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be of any type.
- If initialized with an iterable, it should contain pairs of items where the first item is the key and the second item is the value.

**Returns:**
`dict`: An instance of the dictionary containing the provided key-value pairs or an empty dictionary if no arguments are provided.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When a `dict` is created, it allocates space for the key-value pairs and sets up a hash table for efficient access.
- The keys are hashed to determine their position in the underlying data structure, allowing for average-case constant time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- The `dict` class provides various methods for interacting with the data, such as adding new key-value pairs, removing pairs, and accessing values by their keys.
- The `dict` class does not rely on any external modules, but utilizes Python's built-in capabilities for memory management and hashing.
