# Documentation for `dict`

### dict

**Description:**
The `dict` class in Python is a built-in data structure that provides a way to store key-value pairs. It allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of items based on unique keys. The `dict` class is mutable, meaning that its contents can be changed after creation, and it is unordered, meaning that the items do not have a defined order.

**Parameters:**
None (the `dict` class can be initialized with various optional parameters, but it does not require any).

**Expected Input:**
- The `dict` class can be initialized with an optional iterable of key-value pairs (e.g., a list of tuples) or another dictionary. 
- Keys must be hashable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples) and must be unique within the dictionary.
- Values can be of any data type and can be duplicated.

**Returns:**
`dict`: An instance of the dictionary class that contains the specified key-value pairs.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When a `dict` is created, it can be initialized with no arguments, resulting in an empty dictionary, or with an iterable of key-value pairs, which populates the dictionary with those pairs.
- The `dict` class provides various methods for manipulating the data, including:
  - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the specified key, returning `None` if the key does not exist.
  - `keys()`: Returns a view of the dictionary's keys.
  - `values()`: Returns a view of the dictionary's values.
  - `items()`: Returns a view of the dictionary's key-value pairs.
  - `update(other)`: Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable.
- The underlying implementation of a dictionary uses a hash table, which allows for average-case constant time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- The `dict` class does not have any internal dependencies, making it a core component of the Python language.
