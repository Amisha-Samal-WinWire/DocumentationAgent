# Documentation for `dict`

### dict

**Description:**
The `dict` class in Python is a built-in data structure that provides a mapping from unique keys to values. It allows for the storage and retrieval of data in a key-value pair format, enabling efficient data management and access. The `dict` class supports various operations, including adding, updating, and deleting key-value pairs, as well as checking for the existence of keys.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the `dict` class does not have parameters in the traditional sense, as it is instantiated without explicit parameters).

**Expected Input:**
- The `dict` can be initialized with an optional iterable of key-value pairs (e.g., a list of tuples) or another dictionary. Keys must be hashable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be of any type.
- If no arguments are provided, an empty dictionary is created.

**Returns:**
`dict`: An instance of the dictionary class, which can be used to store key-value pairs.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When a `dict` is created, it initializes an internal hash table to store the key-value pairs.
- The keys are hashed to determine their storage location, allowing for average-case constant time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- The `dict` class provides various methods for interacting with the data, including:
  - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with the specified key, returning `None` if the key does not exist.
  - `keys()`: Returns a view object displaying a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
  - `values()`: Returns a view object displaying a list of all the values in the dictionary.
  - `items()`: Returns a view object displaying a list of key-value pairs as tuples.
  - `update()`: Updates the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable.
- The `dict` class is mutable, meaning that its contents can be changed after creation, allowing for dynamic data management.
