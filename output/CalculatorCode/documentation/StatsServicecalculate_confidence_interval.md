### StatsService.calculate_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence_level: float) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical data points. The confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., mean) with a specified level of confidence. This method utilizes statistical calculations to determine the mean and standard error of the data, and then applies the t-distribution to derive the interval bounds.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values (floats) for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): A decimal value representing the desired confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` must be a list containing numerical values (either integers or floats). The list should not be empty, as a confidence interval cannot be calculated without data.
- `confidence_level` should be a float between 0 and 1, representing the proportion of the population that is expected to fall within the confidence interval. Values outside this range will lead to invalid calculations.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two float values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval, respectively.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by validating the input data to ensure it is a non-empty list of numerical values.
- It calculates the mean of the data using the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library, which computes the average of the elements.
- The standard error of the mean (SEM) is calculated using the formula: SEM = standard deviation / sqrt(n), where `n` is the number of data points. The standard deviation is computed using the `st.sem` function from the statistics library.
- The t-distribution is then used to determine the critical value based on the specified confidence level and the degrees of freedom (n-1). This is done using the `st.t.ppf` function from the statistics library.
- Finally, the method computes the confidence interval bounds by adding and subtracting the product of the critical value and the SEM from the mean, resulting in the lower and upper limits of the interval.
- The method returns the calculated bounds as a tuple.
