### calculate_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence_level: float) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical data. The confidence interval provides a range within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, based on the sample data and the specified confidence level. This method utilizes statistical concepts to derive the interval, which is commonly used in data analysis and inferential statistics.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values (floats) representing the sample data for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): A value between 0 and 1 that represents the desired confidence level for the interval (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of numerical values (floats or integers). An empty list will lead to an error since the calculation requires at least one data point.
- `confidence_level` must be a float between 0 and 1. Values outside this range will result in an error, as they do not represent valid confidence levels.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two float values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval, respectively.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by validating the input data to ensure it is non-empty and that the confidence level is within the acceptable range.
- It calculates the sample mean using the `np.mean` function, which computes the average of the data points.
- The standard error of the mean is computed using the standard deviation of the sample data, which is derived from the `st.sem` function. This standard error reflects the variability of the sample mean.
- The critical value for the specified confidence level is obtained using the `st.t.ppf` function, which provides the t-distribution quantile corresponding to the desired confidence level.
- Finally, the method calculates the margin of error by multiplying the critical value by the standard error, and it constructs the confidence interval by adding and subtracting this margin from the sample mean.
- The resulting lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval are returned as a tuple.
