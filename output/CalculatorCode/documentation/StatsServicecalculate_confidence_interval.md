### StatsService.calculate_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence_level: float) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given list of numerical data at a specified confidence level. The confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the population mean, based on the sample data. This method utilizes statistical functions to compute the mean, standard error, and critical value from the t-distribution, allowing for the estimation of the confidence interval.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values (floats) representing the sample data for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): A decimal value between 0 and 1 representing the desired confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The list must contain valid numerical values; otherwise, the function may raise an error.
- `confidence_level` should be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will not yield a valid confidence interval.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two float values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure it is not empty and contains valid numerical values.
- It calculates the sample mean using the `np.mean` function, which computes the average of the provided data.
- The standard error of the mean is computed using the `st.sem` function, which estimates the variability of the sample mean.
- The critical value for the specified confidence level is determined using the `st.t.ppf` function, which retrieves the t-distribution value corresponding to the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom.
- Finally, the function calculates the margin of error by multiplying the standard error by the critical value, and constructs the confidence interval by adding and subtracting this margin from the sample mean.
- The resulting confidence interval is returned as a tuple, providing a range within which the true population mean is expected to lie with the specified level of confidence.
