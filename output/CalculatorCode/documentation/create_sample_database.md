### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**
The `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.

### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**
The `create_sample_database` function is responsible for creating a sample SQLite database populated with housing data. It first generates a CSV file containing sample data and then establishes a connection to a SQLite database. The function creates a table within the database and populates it with the data from the CSV file, facilitating the testing and demonstration of database operations.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently by generating its own sample data and creating a database.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if a directory for storing the CSV file exists; if not, it creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.
- It then generates a sample DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame` class, which contains predefined housing data.
- This DataFrame is saved to a CSV file using the `df.to_csv` method.
- Before creating the SQLite database, the function checks if a previous database file exists. If it does, it removes the old file using `os.remove` to ensure a fresh start.
- A new SQLite database connection is established using `sqlite3.connect`, and a cursor object is created to execute SQL commands.
- The function creates a table in the database to hold the housing data.
- It then loads the data from the CSV file into the SQLite table using the `df.to_sql` method.
- Finally, the function closes the database connection with `conn.close`, ensuring that all changes are saved and resources are released. Throughout the process, it handles potential errors using `sqlite3.Error` to maintain robustness.

=======
- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently, generating its own data and managing file and database creation.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value. Its purpose is to perform side effects by creating files and a database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if a directory exists for storing the generated CSV file. If it does not exist, it creates the necessary directory structure using `os.makedirs`.
- It then generates a sample DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame`, which contains synthetic housing data.
- The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method, specifying the file path where the CSV will be saved.
- After creating the CSV file, the function establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`. If the database file does not exist, it is created.
- A cursor object is created from the database connection, which is used to execute SQL commands.
- The function creates a new table in the database to store the housing data, using the `execute` method of the cursor to run the appropriate SQL command.
- The data from the DataFrame is then inserted into the newly created table using the `to_sql` method, which facilitates the transfer of data from the DataFrame to the SQL table.
- Finally, the function commits the transaction to ensure that all changes are saved, and it closes the database connection to release resources. Throughout the process, it handles potential errors related to file and database operations, ensuring robust execution.
