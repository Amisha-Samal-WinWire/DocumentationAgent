### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**  
Creates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a generated CSV file. The function automates the process of generating sample data, creating a database, and populating a table with the generated data.

**Parameters:**  
None

**Expected Input:**  
None. The function operates independently and does not require any external input parameters.

**Returns:**  
None. The function does not return any value but creates a database file and populates it with data.

**Detailed Logic:**  
1. **CSV Generation:** The function begins by generating a CSV file containing sample housing data. This data typically includes various attributes relevant to housing, such as price, location, and size.
2. **Database Creation:** After generating the CSV file, the function establishes a connection to a new SQLite database. If the database file already exists, it may overwrite it or append to it based on the implementation.
3. **Table Creation:** The function defines the schema for a table that will hold the housing data. This schema includes the necessary columns that correspond to the attributes in the CSV file.
4. **Data Insertion:** The function reads the generated CSV file and inserts the data into the newly created table within the SQLite database. It ensures that the data is correctly formatted and adheres to the defined schema.
5. **Finalization:** Once the data has been successfully inserted, the function closes the database connection, ensuring that all changes are saved and the database is properly finalized.

This function is designed to streamline the process of setting up a sample database for testing or demonstration purposes, making it easier for developers and testers to work with realistic data without manual input.
