# Documentation for `create_sample_database`

### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**
The `create_sample_database` function creates a sample SQLite database by first generating a CSV file containing sample housing data. It then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file. This function serves as a utility for setting up a test database environment for applications that require housing data.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently, generating its own sample data and managing file and database operations internally.

**Returns:**
None: The function does not return any value. It performs actions to create and populate a database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by generating a CSV file containing sample housing data. This is accomplished using the Pandas library, which creates a DataFrame and exports it to a CSV format.
- It then checks if the CSV file already exists in the specified directory. If it does, the function removes the existing file to ensure that the new data is written fresh.
- After ensuring the CSV file is ready, the function creates a new SQLite database file. It uses the `sqlite3.connect` method to establish a connection to the database.
- A cursor object is created from the connection, which is used to execute SQL commands.
- The function defines the schema for a table that will hold the housing data and executes the SQL command to create this table in the database.
- It then reads the data from the CSV file into a DataFrame and uses the `to_sql` method to insert the data into the newly created table.
- Finally, the function commits the transaction to save the changes and closes the database connection, ensuring that all resources are released properly. Throughout this process, it handles potential errors related to file and database operations, ensuring robust execution.
