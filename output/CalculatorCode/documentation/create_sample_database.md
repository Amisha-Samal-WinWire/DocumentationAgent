# Documentation for `create_sample_database`

### create_sample_database() -> None

**Description:**
The `create_sample_database` function creates a sample SQLite database by first generating a CSV file containing sample housing data. It then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file. This function serves as a utility for setting up a test database environment for applications that require housing data.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently to generate the necessary files and database.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return a value; it performs actions to create and populate a database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by checking if a specific CSV file containing sample housing data already exists. If it does, the function removes it to ensure that a fresh version can be created.
- It then generates a new CSV file with sample data, which includes various attributes related to housing.
- After the CSV file is created, the function establishes a connection to a SQLite database. If the database file does not exist, it will be created automatically.
- A cursor object is then created to execute SQL commands. The function constructs a SQL command to create a new table in the database, defining the necessary columns based on the data structure.
- Once the table is created, the function reads the data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- The DataFrame is then written to the SQL table using the `to_sql` method, which handles the insertion of data into the database.
- Finally, the function closes the database connection, ensuring that all resources are properly released and that the database is ready for subsequent operations.
