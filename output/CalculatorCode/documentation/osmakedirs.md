# Documentation for `os.makedirs`

### os.makedirs(name: str, mode: int = 0o777, exist_ok: bool = False) -> None

**Description:**
The `os.makedirs` function is used to create a directory recursively. This means that if any intermediate-level directories do not exist, they will be created as well. It is particularly useful for ensuring that a specified directory path is fully created without needing to check each level of the directory hierarchy manually.

**Parameters:**
- `name` (`str`): The path of the directory to be created. This can be a relative or absolute path.
- `mode` (`int`, optional): The permissions to set for the newly created directories, expressed as an octal integer. The default is `0o777`, which gives read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.
- `exist_ok` (`bool`, optional): A flag that, when set to `True`, allows the function to succeed even if the target directory already exists. If `False` (the default), an error will be raised if the directory already exists.

**Expected Input:**
- `name` should be a valid string representing the directory path. It can include multiple levels of directories that may not yet exist.
- `mode` should be an integer representing the desired permissions, typically in octal format.
- `exist_ok` should be a boolean value indicating whether to ignore the error if the directory already exists.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return a value. It either successfully creates the directories or raises an error if it fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks if the specified directory path already exists. If `exist_ok` is set to `True`, it will skip the creation process if the directory exists.
- If the directory does not exist, it will create the specified directory and any necessary parent directories along the path.
- The function sets the permissions of the newly created directories according to the provided `mode`.
- If any errors occur during the directory creation process (e.g., permission denied, invalid path), an exception will be raised, unless `exist_ok` is `True` and the directory already exists.
