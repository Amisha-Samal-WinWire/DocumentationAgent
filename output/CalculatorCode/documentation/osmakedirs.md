# Documentation for `os.makedirs`

### os.makedirs(name: str, mode: int = 0o777, exist_ok: bool = False) -> None

**Description:**
The `os.makedirs` function is used to create a directory recursively. This means that if any intermediate-level directories do not exist, they will be created as well. The function can also set permissions for the newly created directories and has an option to avoid raising an error if the target directory already exists.

**Parameters:**
- `name` (`str`): The path of the directory to be created. This can be a relative or absolute path.
- `mode` (`int`, optional): The permissions mode to set for the newly created directories, specified as an octal integer. The default value is `0o777`, which grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.
- `exist_ok` (`bool`, optional): A flag that indicates whether to raise an error if the target directory already exists. If set to `True`, the function will not raise an error if the directory already exists; if set to `False` (the default), it will raise a `FileExistsError`.

**Expected Input:**
- `name` should be a string representing the desired directory path. It can include multiple levels of directories.
- `mode` should be an integer representing the permission settings for the directories. It should be provided in octal format.
- `exist_ok` should be a boolean value indicating the behavior when the target directory already exists.

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value. It either successfully creates the directories or raises an exception if an error occurs.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks if the specified directory path exists. If `exist_ok` is set to `False` and the directory already exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`.
- If the directory does not exist, the function proceeds to create the directory and any necessary parent directories.
- The function uses the specified `mode` to set the permissions for the newly created directories.
- The creation process is handled by the underlying operating system calls, which ensure that the directories are created with the appropriate permissions and structure.
- The function does not have any internal dependencies and operates independently, relying on the operating system's file handling capabilities.
