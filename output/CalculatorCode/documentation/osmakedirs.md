# Documentation for `os.makedirs`

### os.makedirs(name: str, mode: int = 0o777, exist_ok: bool = False) -> None

**Description:**
The `os.makedirs` function is used to create a directory recursively. This means that if any intermediate-level directories do not exist, they will be created as well. This function is particularly useful for ensuring that a specified directory path is fully established before performing operations that require that path.

**Parameters:**
- `name` (`str`): The path of the directory to be created. This can be a relative or absolute path.
- `mode` (`int`, optional): The permissions to set for the newly created directories, expressed as an octal integer. The default value is `0o777`, which grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.
- `exist_ok` (`bool`, optional): A flag that determines the behavior when the target directory already exists. If set to `True`, the function will not raise an error if the directory already exists. If set to `False` (the default), an error will be raised if the directory already exists.

**Expected Input:**
- `name` should be a valid string representing the directory path. It can include multiple levels of directories that need to be created.
- `mode` should be an integer representing the desired permissions for the new directories, typically in octal format.
- `exist_ok` should be a boolean value indicating whether to ignore the error if the directory already exists.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return any value. It either successfully creates the directories or raises an error if the operation fails.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks if the specified path already exists. If `exist_ok` is `False` and the path exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`.
- If the path does not exist, the function proceeds to create the directory and any necessary parent directories. It uses the specified `mode` to set the permissions for the newly created directories.
- The function handles various edge cases, such as invalid paths or permission issues, and raises appropriate exceptions when necessary.
- This function interacts with the operating system's file system to create directories, ensuring that the specified path is fully established for subsequent file operations.
