# Documentation for `conn.close`

### conn.close()

**Description:**
The `conn.close()` function is responsible for terminating a connection to a resource, such as a database or network service. It ensures that all resources associated with the connection are properly released, preventing potential memory leaks and ensuring that no further operations can be performed on the closed connection.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None. The function does not require any input parameters.

**Returns:**
None. The function does not return any value upon execution.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When invoked, `conn.close()` initiates the process of closing the connection associated with the `conn` object.
- The function performs necessary cleanup operations, which may include flushing any pending transactions, releasing network resources, and notifying the underlying system that the connection is no longer in use.
- After the connection is closed, any subsequent attempts to use the `conn` object for operations such as querying or updating data will result in an error, as the connection is no longer active.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates independently, relying solely on the state of the `conn` object to execute its logic.
