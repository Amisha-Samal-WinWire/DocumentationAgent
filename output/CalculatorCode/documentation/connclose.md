# Documentation for `conn.close`

### conn.close()

**Description:**
The `conn.close()` function is responsible for closing a database connection that was previously established. This function ensures that all resources associated with the connection are released and that any pending transactions are finalized. Properly closing connections is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the database and preventing resource leaks.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This function does not require any input parameters. It is called on an instance of a connection object that has been previously opened.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- When `conn.close()` is invoked, it initiates the process of terminating the connection to the database.
- The function performs necessary cleanup operations, which may include:
  - Committing any uncommitted transactions to ensure data integrity.
  - Releasing any resources (such as memory or file handles) that were allocated for the connection.
  - Notifying the database server that the connection is no longer needed.
- This function does not return any value and is typically called as part of a cleanup routine, often in a `finally` block or after all database operations have been completed to ensure that the connection is properly closed regardless of whether an error occurred during the operations.
