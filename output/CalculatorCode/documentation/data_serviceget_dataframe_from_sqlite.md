# Documentation for `data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite()

**Description:**
Retrieves a DataFrame from a SQLite database by executing a specified SQL query. This function serves as a bridge between the SQLite database and the data analysis environment, allowing users to easily access and manipulate data stored in SQLite format.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (`str`): The SQL query string to be executed against the SQLite database. This query should be valid SQL syntax and should return a result set that can be converted into a DataFrame.
- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database file. This path must point to a valid SQLite database file on the filesystem.

**Expected Input:**
- `query` should be a well-formed SQL query string that adheres to SQLite syntax rules.
- `db_path` should be a string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file. If the file does not exist or is inaccessible, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. The DataFrame will have columns corresponding to the fields returned by the query and rows corresponding to the records retrieved.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `db_path`.
- It then executes the SQL `query` against the database connection.
- The results of the query are fetched and converted into a pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the function returns the DataFrame to the caller, allowing for further data manipulation and analysis.
- Error handling is implemented to manage potential issues such as invalid SQL syntax, connection failures, or file access problems, ensuring that the function behaves predictably under various conditions.
