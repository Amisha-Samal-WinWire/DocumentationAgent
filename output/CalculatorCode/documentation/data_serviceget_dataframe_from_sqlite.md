# Documentation for `data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite()

**Description:**
This function retrieves data from a SQLite database and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame. It facilitates the extraction of structured data from a SQLite database, enabling further analysis and manipulation using the powerful features of the Pandas library.

**Parameters:**
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `query` (`str`): A SQL query string that specifies the data to be fetched from the database.

**Expected Input:**
- `database_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement that is syntactically correct and targets the appropriate tables and columns within the database.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. The DataFrame will have columns corresponding to the selected fields in the query and rows representing the records returned by the query.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `database_path`.
- It then executes the specified SQL `query` against the database.
- The results of the query are fetched and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the function returns the DataFrame, allowing users to leverage Pandas' data manipulation capabilities for further analysis or processing.
- The function handles potential exceptions related to database access and query execution, ensuring that errors are managed gracefully.
