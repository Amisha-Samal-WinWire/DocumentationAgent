# Documentation for `np.median`

### np.median(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, out: Optional[np.ndarray] = None, overwrite_input: bool = False, keepdims: bool = False) -> float

**Description:**
Calculates the median of the given array or dataset along the specified axis. The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of the data sample. This function is useful for statistical analysis and data processing, providing a robust measure of central tendency that is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or dataset from which the median is to be computed. This can be a list, tuple, or a NumPy array.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis along which the median is computed. By default, the median is computed over the flattened array. If an integer is provided, the median is calculated along that specific axis.
- `out` (`Optional[np.ndarray]`): An optional output array where the result will be stored. If provided, it must have a shape that matches the expected output.
- `overwrite_input` (`bool`, default: `False`): If set to `True`, allows the input array to be modified in place for performance reasons. This can lead to loss of the original data.
- `keepdims` (`bool`, default: `False`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the output as dimensions with size one, allowing for easier broadcasting.

**Expected Input:**
- `a` should be a numerical array-like structure (e.g., list, tuple, or NumPy array) containing integers or floats.
- The `axis` parameter should be an integer or `None`. If an integer is provided, it must be within the bounds of the dimensions of `a`.
- The `out` parameter, if specified, must be a NumPy array of the appropriate shape.
- The `overwrite_input` parameter should be a boolean value.
- The `keepdims` parameter should also be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`float`: The median value of the input array along the specified axis. If the input is multidimensional and `keepdims` is set to `True`, the return type will be an array with the same number of dimensions as the input.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input array and determining its shape.
- If the `axis` parameter is specified, it computes the median along that axis; otherwise, it flattens the array and computes the median of all elements.
- The function handles cases where the input array has an even number of elements by averaging the two middle values.
- If `overwrite_input` is set to `True`, the function may modify the input array to optimize performance, which can lead to data loss.
- The result is then returned, either as a single float or as an array, depending on the `keepdims` parameter and the dimensionality of the input.
