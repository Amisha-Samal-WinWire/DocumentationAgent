# Documentation for `ConfidenceIntervalInput`

### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
`ConfidenceIntervalInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of confidence intervals. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its properties and methods to ensure a consistent structure for confidence interval computations within the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class does not specify any input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is expected that derived classes or instances will provide the necessary attributes for confidence interval calculations, such as sample data, confidence level, or other statistical parameters.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ConfidenceIntervalInput` inherits the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`, which may include methods for data validation and serialization.
- The class is intended to encapsulate the specific logic and attributes required for confidence interval calculations, although the exact implementation details are not provided in the current documentation.
- The design promotes code reuse and consistency, allowing for the integration of confidence interval calculations within a broader statistical analysis framework in the application. The class may interact with other components or models that handle statistical data processing, but specific interactions are not detailed in the provided information.
