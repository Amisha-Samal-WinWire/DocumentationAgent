### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**  
The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class serves as a model for calculating confidence intervals in statistical analysis. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to define the parameters for confidence interval calculations, ensuring that the data is structured and accessible for further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None

**Expected Input:**  
- The class does not specify any input parameters at the time of instantiation. However, it is expected that the attributes relevant to confidence interval calculations will be set after the object is created. These attributes typically include sample data, confidence level, and other statistical parameters necessary for the calculation.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class is designed to hold data related to confidence intervals. While the specific attributes and methods are not detailed in the provided information, the class likely includes mechanisms to store and retrieve statistical data.
- The class may also include validation logic to ensure that the input data adheres to statistical requirements, such as checking for valid sample sizes or confidence levels.
- As a model, it serves as a foundational component that can be utilized by other parts of the application to perform calculations and generate results related to confidence intervals. The class does not interact with external modules or dependencies, focusing solely on encapsulating the necessary data for confidence interval computations.
