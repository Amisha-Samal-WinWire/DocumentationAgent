# Documentation for `ConfidenceIntervalInput`

### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
`ConfidenceIntervalInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of confidence intervals within the application. It inherits from the `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational structure to implement specific attributes and methods related to confidence interval computations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ConfidenceIntervalInput` does not require specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is expected that any attributes or parameters relevant to confidence interval calculations will be defined within this class or its methods.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- `ConfidenceIntervalInput` extends the functionality of `BaseModel`, which serves as a template for other models. While the specific logic for confidence interval calculations is not detailed in the provided information, it is implied that this class will implement methods and properties necessary for handling the inputs and computations associated with confidence intervals.
- The class is expected to encapsulate the necessary data and behaviors that pertain to confidence intervals, such as storing input data, performing calculations, and possibly validating inputs.
- By inheriting from `BaseModel`, `ConfidenceIntervalInput` benefits from the shared behaviors and attributes defined in the base class, promoting code reuse and consistency across the application.
