### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class serves as a model for calculating confidence intervals. It encapsulates the necessary attributes and methods required to perform statistical calculations related to confidence intervals, providing a structured way to manage input data and parameters.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (The class does not explicitly define parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The class is expected to handle input data relevant to confidence interval calculations, which typically includes sample data, confidence level, and possibly other statistical parameters. The exact nature of the input data is not specified in the provided context, but it should conform to the requirements of statistical analysis.

**Returns:**
- None (The class itself does not return values but is designed to facilitate the calculation of confidence intervals).

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class likely inherits from `BaseModel`, which suggests that it may utilize or override methods and properties defined in the `BaseModel` class. This inheritance allows it to leverage existing functionality related to data validation, serialization, or other model behaviors.
- The class is designed to encapsulate the logic necessary for managing the input required for confidence interval calculations. This may include methods for setting and retrieving input values, validating the data, and preparing it for further statistical processing.
- The specific algorithms or calculations performed by this class are not detailed in the provided context, but it is expected to interact with statistical functions or libraries to compute the confidence intervals based on the input data it manages.

### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
`ConfidenceIntervalInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of confidence intervals. It extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its properties and methods to ensure a consistent structure for confidence interval computations within the application.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class does not specify any input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is expected that derived classes or instances will provide the necessary attributes for confidence interval calculations, such as sample data, confidence level, or other statistical parameters.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ConfidenceIntervalInput` inherits the foundational behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`, which may include methods for data validation and serialization.
- The class is intended to encapsulate the specific logic and attributes required for confidence interval calculations, although the exact implementation details are not provided in the current documentation.
- The design promotes code reuse and consistency, allowing for the integration of confidence interval calculations within a broader statistical analysis framework in the application. The class may interact with other components or models that handle statistical data processing, but specific interactions are not detailed in the provided information.
