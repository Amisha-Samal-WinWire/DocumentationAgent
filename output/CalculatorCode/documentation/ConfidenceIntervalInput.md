# Documentation for `ConfidenceIntervalInput`

### ConfidenceIntervalInput

**Description:**
`ConfidenceIntervalInput` is a model class designed to facilitate the calculation of confidence intervals. It serves as a structured input for the parameters required in the confidence interval computation, ensuring that the necessary data is organized and accessible for further processing.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The `ConfidenceIntervalInput` class is expected to be instantiated with data relevant to confidence interval calculations, although specific input parameters are not detailed in the provided context. It is implied that the class will be used in conjunction with other components that define the necessary inputs for confidence interval computations.

**Returns:**
None (the class does not return any values upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `ConfidenceIntervalInput` inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides foundational functionality and attributes for model classes. This inheritance allows `ConfidenceIntervalInput` to leverage shared behaviors defined in `BaseModel`, promoting code reuse and consistency.
- The class is intended to encapsulate the input data required for confidence interval calculations, although the specific attributes and methods are not detailed in the provided context.
- As a subclass of `BaseModel`, `ConfidenceIntervalInput` can override or extend the functionality of its parent class, allowing for specialized behavior while maintaining a consistent interface with other models in the application.
- The design of this class aligns with the overall architecture of the application, which emphasizes organized model management and the encapsulation of related data and behaviors.
