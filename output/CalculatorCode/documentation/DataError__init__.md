### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `DataError.__init__` method is a constructor for the `DataError` class, which is likely a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing or validation within the application. This method initializes the exception with a message and potentially other attributes inherited from its parent class.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the error encountered. This message is passed to the parent class's constructor to ensure that the error context is preserved.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that describes the nature of the data error. It is expected to provide sufficient context for debugging or logging purposes. There are no specific constraints on the content of the message, but it should be meaningful and informative.

**Returns:**
None: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `DataError` instance to inherit the properties and behaviors of the base exception class.
- The `message` parameter is passed to the parent class's constructor, which typically sets the error message that can be retrieved later when the exception is raised or caught.
- This method does not contain additional logic beyond the initialization process, as its primary role is to set up the exception with the provided message.
