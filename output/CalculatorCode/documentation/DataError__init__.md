**Dependencies:**
- `super().__init__`
### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `DataError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `DataError` class, allowing for the inclusion of a specific error message that describes the nature of the data-related issue encountered.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: (`DataError`): The instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the data error. This message is passed to the parent class's initializer to ensure that the error can be properly reported.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that conveys the specific error encountered during data processing. It is expected to be informative enough to assist in debugging or understanding the context of the error.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return any value; it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method begins by calling the `__init__` method of its parent class using `super()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, which may include setting up the exception's message and other attributes.
- The `message` parameter is passed to the parent class's initializer, allowing the `DataError` instance to inherit the behavior of standard exception handling while providing a specific context related to data errors.
- This method does not contain any additional logic beyond the initialization process, relying on the parent class to manage the exception's behavior and representation.
