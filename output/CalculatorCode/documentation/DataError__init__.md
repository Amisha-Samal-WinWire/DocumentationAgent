**Dependencies:**
- `super().__init__`
### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `DataError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. Its constructor initializes the exception with a message that provides context about the error encountered.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that explains the nature of the data error. This message is passed to the parent class's constructor to ensure that it is properly recorded and can be retrieved later.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that conveys relevant information about the data error. It is expected to be non-empty to provide meaningful context for debugging.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of `DataError` calls the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that the error message is properly set up in the base exception class, allowing it to be raised and caught in the application.
- The primary purpose of this method is to facilitate the creation of a `DataError` instance with a specific error message, which can then be used to signal issues related to data integrity or processing within the application.
