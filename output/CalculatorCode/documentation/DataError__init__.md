### DataError.__init__()

**Description:**  
The `DataError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `DataError` class, allowing for the inclusion of a specific error message that describes the nature of the data-related issue.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the data error encountered.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `message` parameter should be a string that conveys the specifics of the error. It is expected to be informative enough to help users or developers understand the context of the error.

**Returns:**  
None: The `__init__` method does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `__init__` method of the `DataError` class is called when an instance of the class is created.
- It accepts a `message` parameter that is typically passed when raising the exception.
- The method likely calls the parent class's `__init__` method to ensure that the base exception class is properly initialized with the provided message.
- This allows the `DataError` to inherit all the properties and behaviors of standard exception classes while adding custom functionality specific to data errors.
- The class is designed to be raised in scenarios where data integrity issues arise, providing a clear and specific error message to facilitate debugging and error handling.
