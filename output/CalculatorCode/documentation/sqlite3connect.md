# Documentation for `sqlite3.connect`

### sqlite3.connect(database: str, timeout: float = 5.0, detect_types: int = 0, isolation_level: Optional[str] = None, check_same_thread: bool = True, factory: Optional[Type[Connection]] = None, cached_statements: int = 128, uri: bool = False) -> Connection

**Description:**
Establishes a connection to a SQLite database specified by the `database` parameter. If the database does not exist, it will be created. This function is a key entry point for interacting with SQLite databases, allowing users to execute SQL commands, manage transactions, and retrieve data.

**Parameters:**
- `database` (`str`): The name of the database file to connect to. This can also be a path to a database file.
- `timeout` (`float`, optional): The number of seconds to wait for the database lock to be released before raising an error. Default is 5.0 seconds.
- `detect_types` (`int`, optional): A flag that determines how to interpret the types of the columns in the database. Default is 0, which means no special type detection.
- `isolation_level` (`Optional[str]`, optional): The isolation level for the connection. If `None`, the default isolation level is used.
- `check_same_thread` (`bool`, optional): If set to `True`, the connection can only be used in the same thread that created it. Default is `True`.
- `factory` (`Optional[Type[Connection]]`, optional): A custom connection class to be used instead of the default.
- `cached_statements` (`int`, optional): The number of statements to cache for reuse. Default is 128.
- `uri` (`bool`, optional): If set to `True`, the `database` parameter is treated as a URI. Default is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- `database` must be a valid string representing the database file name or path.
- `timeout` should be a non-negative float.
- `detect_types` should be an integer that specifies the type detection behavior.
- `isolation_level` can be a string representing the desired isolation level or `None`.
- `check_same_thread` should be a boolean indicating thread safety.
- `factory` should be a class type that extends the `Connection` class or `None`.
- `cached_statements` should be a non-negative integer.
- `uri` should be a boolean indicating whether to interpret the `database` as a URI.

**Returns:**
`Connection`: An instance of the `Connection` class representing the established connection to the SQLite database.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure they meet the expected types and constraints.
- It attempts to open a connection to the specified database file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new database file.
- The function manages database locking by implementing the timeout mechanism, allowing the caller to specify how long to wait for a lock to be released.
- It sets up the connection's isolation level, which controls how transactions are handled.
- If `check_same_thread` is enabled, the connection will enforce that it is only accessed from the thread that created it, ensuring thread safety.
- The function may utilize a custom connection factory if provided, allowing for extended functionality.
- Finally, it prepares the connection for use, including setting up statement caching for performance optimization.
