# Documentation for `sqlite3.connect`

### sqlite3.connect(database: str, timeout: float = 5.0, detect_types: int = 0, isolation_level: Optional[str] = None, check_same_thread: bool = True, factory: Optional[Type[Connection]] = None, cached_statements: int = 128, uri: bool = False) -> Connection

**Description:**
Establishes a connection to a SQLite database specified by the `database` parameter. If the database does not exist, it will be created. This function is essential for interacting with SQLite databases, allowing users to execute SQL commands and manage data.

**Parameters:**
- `database` (`str`): The path to the SQLite database file. If the file does not exist, a new database file will be created.
- `timeout` (`float`, optional): The number of seconds to wait for the database lock to clear before raising an error. The default is 5.0 seconds.
- `detect_types` (`int`, optional): A bitwise OR of the type detection flags. The default is 0, which means no type detection.
- `isolation_level` (`Optional[str]`, optional): The isolation level for the connection. If set to `None`, autocommit mode is enabled. Default is `None`.
- `check_same_thread` (`bool`, optional): If set to `True`, the connection can only be used in the same thread where it was created. Default is `True`.
- `factory` (`Optional[Type[Connection]]`, optional): A custom connection class that will be used instead of the default. Default is `None`.
- `cached_statements` (`int`, optional): The number of statements to cache for reuse. Default is 128.
- `uri` (`bool`, optional): If set to `True`, the `database` parameter is treated as a URI. Default is `False`.

**Expected Input:**
- `database` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file or a new file to be created.
- `timeout` should be a non-negative float indicating the wait time for acquiring a lock.
- `detect_types` should be an integer representing the desired type detection behavior.
- `isolation_level` should be a string representing the desired transaction isolation level or `None`.
- `check_same_thread` should be a boolean indicating whether the connection can be shared across threads.
- `factory` should be a class type that inherits from `Connection`, or `None`.
- `cached_statements` should be a positive integer indicating the number of cached statements.
- `uri` should be a boolean indicating whether to treat the database parameter as a URI.

**Returns:**
`Connection`: An object representing the connection to the SQLite database, which can be used to execute SQL commands and manage transactions.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the `database` parameter to ensure it is a valid string.
- It then sets up the connection parameters, including timeout and isolation level, based on the provided arguments.
- If the `database` does not exist, the function creates a new database file.
- The connection is established using the SQLite library, and the appropriate settings are applied based on the parameters.
- The function returns a `Connection` object, which can be used to perform database operations such as executing queries, committing transactions, and closing the connection.
- This function interacts with the SQLite database engine, managing the underlying connection and ensuring that the specified parameters are honored during the connection process.
