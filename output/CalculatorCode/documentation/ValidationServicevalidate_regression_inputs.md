### ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs(payload: RegressionInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_regression_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data required for regression analysis. It connects to a database to ensure that the specified columns exist and are of a numeric type, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data before any regression analysis is performed.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data for regression analysis. This model includes the necessary attributes that need to be validated against the database.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` must be an instance of the `RegressionInput` model, which should contain fields that correspond to the expected columns in the database for regression analysis. The values in these fields should be structured in a way that they can be validated against the database schema.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by utilizing the `DataService.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` function to retrieve the relevant data from a SQLite database. This function connects to the database and fetches the entire table as a pandas DataFrame.
- After obtaining the DataFrame, the method checks for the existence of the specified columns in the DataFrame. It verifies that these columns are present and that they contain numeric data types using the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function.
- If any of the validation checks fail—such as missing columns or non-numeric data types—the method raises a `DataError` exception. This custom exception provides a clear indication of the nature of the validation failure, allowing for appropriate error handling in the application.
- Overall, this method serves as a critical step in ensuring that the data used for regression analysis is valid and reliable, preventing potential errors during the analysis phase.

### ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs(payload: RegressionInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_regression_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data for regression analysis by ensuring that the specified columns exist in the database and that they contain numeric values. It connects the `RegressionInput` model with the `DataService` to perform comprehensive validation checks, ensuring data integrity before proceeding with regression analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data for regression analysis, including the columns to be validated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` parameter must be an instance of the `RegressionInput` model, which should contain the necessary attributes representing the columns intended for regression analysis. The attributes must be defined in accordance with the expected schema for regression inputs.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. Its primary function is to validate the input data and raise exceptions if any validation checks fail.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the relevant data from the database using the `DataService` to obtain a DataFrame that corresponds to the columns specified in the `payload`.
- It then checks for the existence of each column listed in the `payload` within the DataFrame. If any column is missing, a `DataError` is raised to indicate the validation failure.
- Following the existence check, the method verifies that each specified column contains numeric data types. This is accomplished using the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function, which checks the data type of each column.
- If any column fails the numeric check, the method raises a `DataError`, providing feedback on which specific column(s) did not meet the validation criteria.
- The method also checks for null values in the specified columns, raising a `DataError` if any null entries are found, thereby ensuring that the data is complete and valid for regression analysis.
