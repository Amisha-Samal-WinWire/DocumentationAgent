### ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs(payload: RegressionInput) -> None

**Description:**  
The `validate_regression_inputs` method is responsible for validating the input data required for regression analysis. It connects to the database to ensure that the specified columns exist and that they contain numeric values, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data before proceeding with further analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): An instance of the Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data for regression analysis. This model includes the necessary fields that must be validated against the database.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `payload` should be a valid instance of `RegressionInput`, which must contain all required fields for regression analysis. The fields specified in this model should correspond to the columns expected in the database, and they must be numeric in nature. Any deviation from these requirements will trigger validation errors.

**Returns:**  
None: This method does not return a value. Instead, it performs validation checks and raises exceptions if any issues are found.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method begins by extracting the necessary column names from the `payload` provided.
- It then establishes a connection to the database to check for the existence of these columns.
- For each column, the method verifies that it is present in the database schema and that its data type is numeric.
- If any of the validation checks fail, the method raises a `DataError`, providing a descriptive message that indicates the nature of the validation failure.
- This process ensures that only valid and appropriate data is used for regression analysis, thereby preventing potential errors during computation and analysis stages.
- The method exemplifies the integration of the `RegressionInput` model with the `DataService`, showcasing a robust validation mechanism that enhances data integrity within the application.
