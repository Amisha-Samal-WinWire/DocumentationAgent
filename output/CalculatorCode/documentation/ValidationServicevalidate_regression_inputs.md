### ValidationService.validate_regression_inputs(payload: RegressionInput) -> None

**Description:**
The `validate_regression_inputs` method is responsible for validating the inputs required for a regression analysis. It connects to a database to ensure that the specified columns exist and are of a numeric type. This method serves as a critical validation step, ensuring that the data integrity is maintained before proceeding with regression analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data for regression analysis. This model includes the necessary attributes that need to be validated against the database.

**Expected Input:**
- The `payload` parameter must be an instance of the `RegressionInput` model, which should contain attributes that specify the columns to be validated. The columns referenced in the payload must exist in the database and should be numeric in nature. If the payload does not conform to these requirements, a validation error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`None`: The method does not return a value. Instead, it performs validation checks and raises an exception if any of the checks fail.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by retrieving the relevant data from the database using the `DataService` to fetch a DataFrame that contains the columns specified in the `payload`.
- It then iterates through each column specified in the `payload` to check for its existence in the DataFrame.
- For each column, it verifies that the column is numeric using the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function. This ensures that the data type of the column is appropriate for regression analysis.
- Additionally, the method checks for any null values in the specified columns using the `isnull()` method, which could indicate incomplete data.
- If any of these validation checks fail (i.e., a column does not exist, is not numeric, or contains null values), the method raises a `DataError`, providing feedback on the specific validation issue encountered.
- This method effectively ensures that only valid and complete data is used for regression analysis, thereby enhancing the reliability of the results.
