# Documentation for `Jinja2Templates`

### Jinja2Templates

**Description:**
`Jinja2Templates` is a class designed to facilitate the rendering of templates using the Jinja2 templating engine. It serves as a wrapper that integrates Jinja2 with a web framework, allowing developers to easily create dynamic HTML content by combining templates with data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `directory` (`str`): The directory path where the template files are stored. This is essential for locating the templates to be rendered.
- `environment` (`jinja2.Environment`): An optional parameter that allows customization of the Jinja2 environment settings, such as filters, globals, and other configurations.

**Expected Input:**
- The `directory` parameter should be a valid string path pointing to the location of the template files. It must exist and be accessible by the application.
- The `environment` parameter, if provided, should be an instance of `jinja2.Environment`, allowing for advanced configurations.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation. Instead, it prepares the environment for rendering templates.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, `Jinja2Templates` sets up the Jinja2 environment by loading templates from the specified directory.
- It may configure the environment with custom settings if an `environment` parameter is provided.
- The class provides methods for rendering templates by combining them with context data, enabling the dynamic generation of HTML content based on the provided data.
- The rendering process involves looking up the specified template, processing it with the provided context, and returning the final rendered output, which can be served as part of a web response. 

This class is integral for applications that require dynamic content generation, leveraging the powerful features of the Jinja2 templating engine.
