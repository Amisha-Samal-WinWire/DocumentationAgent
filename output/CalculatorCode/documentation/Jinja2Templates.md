# Documentation for `Jinja2Templates`

### Jinja2Templates

**Description:**
`Jinja2Templates` is a class designed to facilitate the rendering of templates using the Jinja2 templating engine within a web application framework. It provides an interface for loading and rendering templates, allowing developers to create dynamic HTML content by combining static templates with dynamic data.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `directory` (`str`): The directory path where the template files are stored. This is essential for locating the templates to be rendered.
- `environment` (`jinja2.Environment`): An instance of the Jinja2 environment that configures the template rendering settings, such as autoescaping and loader settings.

**Expected Input:**
- The `directory` parameter should be a valid string path pointing to the location of the template files.
- The `environment` parameter should be an instance of the Jinja2 `Environment` class, which is responsible for managing the template rendering context.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return any value upon instantiation. Instead, it sets up the necessary environment for rendering templates.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, `Jinja2Templates` sets up the specified directory for template storage and configures the Jinja2 environment.
- The class provides methods to render templates by combining them with context data. This involves looking up the template file in the specified directory and processing it with the provided context.
- The rendering process utilizes the Jinja2 engine's capabilities to handle template inheritance, control structures, and variable interpolation.
- The class does not have any internal dependencies, relying solely on the Jinja2 library for its functionality. It streamlines the process of rendering templates, making it easier for developers to generate dynamic content in their applications.
