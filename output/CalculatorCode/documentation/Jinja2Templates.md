# Documentation for `Jinja2Templates`

### Jinja2Templates

**Description:**
`Jinja2Templates` is a class designed to facilitate the rendering of templates using the Jinja2 templating engine. It provides a structured way to manage and render HTML templates, allowing for dynamic content generation in web applications. This class abstracts the complexities of template loading and rendering, enabling developers to easily integrate Jinja2 into their projects.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `directory` (`str`): The directory path where the template files are stored. This is essential for locating the templates to be rendered.
- `environment` (`jinja2.Environment`): An instance of the Jinja2 environment that configures the template rendering settings, such as autoescaping and template loaders.

**Expected Input:**
- The `directory` parameter should be a valid string representing a file path that exists on the filesystem.
- The `environment` parameter should be an instance of the Jinja2 `Environment` class, which is responsible for managing the rendering context and settings.

**Returns:**
`None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it prepares the environment for rendering templates.

**Detailed Logic:**
- Upon initialization, the `Jinja2Templates` class sets up the directory for template storage and configures the Jinja2 environment.
- It utilizes the specified directory to load templates when rendering is requested.
- The class provides methods to render templates by passing context variables, which are then injected into the templates during the rendering process.
- The rendering process involves looking up the specified template within the directory, processing it with the provided context, and returning the final rendered HTML output.
- The class is designed to work seamlessly with web frameworks, allowing for easy integration into web applications that require dynamic content generation.
