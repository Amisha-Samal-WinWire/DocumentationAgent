### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component for defining and organizing API routes within the application. It utilizes the `APIRouter` from an external library to facilitate the creation of modular and maintainable API endpoints. This module is designed to streamline the process of including various routers into the main application, enhancing the overall structure and readability of the codebase.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module does not take any direct input parameters. However, it is expected to be integrated into a larger application context where it will interact with other modules and routers.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of `APIRouter`, which is a class designed to manage routes in a FastAPI application.
- It may include various route definitions and configurations that dictate how incoming requests are handled.
- The module likely utilizes the `include_router` function from an external library to incorporate additional routers, allowing for a hierarchical organization of routes.
- This setup promotes a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and scale the API as new features are added or existing ones are modified.
- The logic within this module is primarily focused on routing and does not perform any business logic or data processing directly. Instead, it delegates those responsibilities to the respective route handlers defined elsewhere in the codebase.

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a central component within the API structure of the application, specifically designed to define and manage API routes. It utilizes the `APIRouter` class to facilitate the organization of endpoints, ensuring that incoming HTTP requests are efficiently routed to their corresponding handler functions.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not define any parameters or attributes upon its instantiation.

**Expected Input:**
- The `module_code` is expected to be integrated within a web application context where it will handle HTTP requests. It is designed to work with various routes defined by the user, which will be processed through the `APIRouter`.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The `module_code` does not return any value upon execution.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` initializes an instance of the `APIRouter`, which is responsible for managing the API routes.
- It defines various endpoints by specifying the HTTP methods (such as GET, POST) and the corresponding paths for each route.
- When an HTTP request is received, the `APIRouter` matches the request's method and path against its defined routes to determine the appropriate handler function to invoke.
- The `module_code` may also incorporate middleware support, allowing for pre-processing of requests before they reach the designated handler functions.
- Overall, the `module_code` streamlines the API routing process, making it easier to maintain and scale the web application while ensuring efficient request handling.
