# Documentation for `api_router.include_router`

### api_router.include_router(router: Router, prefix: Optional[str] = None, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, dependencies: Optional[List[Depends]] = None, responses: Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]] = None) -> None

**Description:**
The `include_router` method is a part of the FastAPI framework that allows for the inclusion of another router into the main application router. This facilitates modular design by enabling developers to organize routes into separate routers, which can then be included in the main application with optional prefixes, tags, and other configurations.

**Parameters:**
- `router` (`Router`): An instance of the FastAPI `Router` class that contains the routes to be included in the main application.
- `prefix` (`Optional[str]`): A string that will be prefixed to all routes in the included router. This allows for namespacing of routes.
- `tags` (`Optional[List[str]]`): A list of tags that can be associated with the routes in the included router for documentation purposes.
- `dependencies` (`Optional[List[Depends]]`): A list of dependencies that will be applied to all routes in the included router. This is useful for shared authentication or other middleware.
- `responses` (`Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]]`): A dictionary that defines custom responses for specific status codes that can be used across the included routes.

**Expected Input:**
- `router` must be a valid instance of the FastAPI `Router` class.
- `prefix` should be a string that represents a valid URL path prefix or `None` if no prefix is needed.
- `tags` should be a list of strings, each representing a tag for documentation, or `None`.
- `dependencies` should be a list of FastAPI `Depends` instances or `None`.
- `responses` should be a dictionary mapping HTTP status codes to response descriptions or `None`.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return any value. It modifies the main router by adding the routes from the included router.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by validating the provided `router` to ensure it is an instance of the `Router` class.
- If a `prefix` is provided, it prepends this prefix to all routes defined in the included router, effectively namespacing them under the specified path.
- The `tags` parameter allows for the categorization of the routes in the API documentation, making it easier for users to navigate.
- Any dependencies specified are applied to all routes in the included router, allowing for shared logic such as authentication or request validation.
- The `responses` parameter enables the definition of custom responses for specific status codes, enhancing the API's documentation and usability.
- Finally, the method integrates the included router into the main application router, allowing all routes to be accessible as part of the overall API.
