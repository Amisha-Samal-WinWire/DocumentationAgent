# Documentation for `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### get_dataframe_from_sqlite()

**Description:**
Retrieves data from a SQLite database and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame. This function facilitates the extraction of structured data from a SQLite database, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.

**Parameters:**
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `query` (`str`): A SQL query string that specifies the data to be fetched from the database.

**Expected Input:**
- `database_path` should be a valid string representing the file path to an existing SQLite database. The path must be accessible and the database should be in a readable state.
- `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement. It must conform to SQL syntax and should be designed to return data in a format compatible with Pandas DataFrame.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. The DataFrame will have columns corresponding to the fields selected in the SQL query and rows representing the records returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `database_path`.
- It then executes the specified SQL `query` against the database.
- The results of the query are fetched and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the function returns the DataFrame, which can be used for further data analysis or manipulation.
- This function relies on the Pandas library for DataFrame creation and may utilize SQLite's built-in functions for executing queries and managing database connections.
