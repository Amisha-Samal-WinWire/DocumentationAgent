# Documentation for `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### get_dataframe_from_sqlite()

**Description:**
Retrieves data from a SQLite database and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame. This function facilitates the extraction of structured data from a SQLite database, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.

**Parameters:**
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `query` (`str`): A SQL query string that specifies the data to be fetched from the database.

**Expected Input:**
- `database_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `query` should be a valid SQL SELECT statement that can be executed against the specified database. It must return data in a format that can be converted into a DataFrame.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. The DataFrame will have columns corresponding to the fields selected in the query and rows corresponding to the records returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `database_path`.
- It then executes the specified SQL `query` against the database.
- The results of the query are fetched and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the function closes the database connection and returns the DataFrame containing the queried data.
- This function relies on the Pandas library for DataFrame creation and manipulation, as well as the SQLite library for database interactions.
