# Documentation for `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`

### get_dataframe_from_sqlite() -> pandas.DataFrame

**Description:**
Retrieves data from a SQLite database and returns it as a pandas DataFrame. This function facilitates the extraction of structured data from a SQLite database, making it easier to manipulate and analyze within a Python environment.

**Parameters:**
- `database_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.
- `query` (`str`): The SQL query string that specifies the data to be fetched from the database.

**Expected Input:**
- `database_path` should be a valid string representing the file path to an existing SQLite database file.
- `query` should be a valid SQL query string that can be executed against the SQLite database. The query must be correctly formatted to return the desired results.

**Returns:**
`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the results of the executed SQL query. If the query returns no results, an empty DataFrame will be returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by establishing a connection to the SQLite database using the provided `database_path`.
- It then executes the specified SQL `query` against the connected database.
- The results of the query are fetched and converted into a pandas DataFrame.
- Finally, the function closes the database connection and returns the DataFrame containing the queried data.
- This function leverages the capabilities of the `sqlite3` module for database interaction and the `pandas` library for data manipulation and representation.
