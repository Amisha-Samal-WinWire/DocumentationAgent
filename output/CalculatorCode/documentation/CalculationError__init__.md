### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError.__init__` method is a constructor for the `CalculationError` class, which is a custom exception used to signal errors that occur during calculations in the application. This method initializes the exception with a specific message and any additional attributes necessary for error handling.

**Parameters:**
- `self` (`CalculationError`): The instance of the `CalculationError` class being created.
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the error encountered during a calculation. This message is intended to help the user understand the nature of the error.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that clearly describes the error. It is expected to be non-empty to ensure that the error context is communicated effectively.

**Returns:**
`None`: This method does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `CalculationError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that the base exception class is properly initialized with the provided error message.
- By leveraging the parent class's initialization, `CalculationError` inherits all the standard behaviors of Python exceptions, including the ability to be raised and caught in try-except blocks.
- The `message` parameter is crucial as it allows the exception to convey specific information about the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.

### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError` class is a custom exception that is raised to indicate errors that occur during calculations within the application. This class extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling related to calculation failures.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class.
- `message` (`str`, optional): A descriptive message that provides details about the error. This message is passed to the base exception class to convey the nature of the calculation error.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that describes the error encountered during a calculation. If no message is provided, the default behavior of the base exception class will apply.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of the `CalculationError` class calls the `__init__` method of its superclass (the base exception class) using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that the base class is properly initialized with the provided error message.
- By extending the base exception class, `CalculationError` allows developers to raise this specific exception type in their code, facilitating more granular error handling for calculation-related issues. This can be particularly useful in debugging and logging, as it provides context-specific information about the nature of the error encountered.
