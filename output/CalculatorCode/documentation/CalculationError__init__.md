### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError.__init__` method is a constructor for the `CalculationError` class, which is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur during mathematical calculations. This class extends the base exception class, allowing it to inherit standard exception behavior while providing a specific context for calculation-related errors.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: (`CalculationError`): The instance of the class being created.
- `message` (`str`, optional): A descriptive message that provides details about the error. This message is passed to the base exception class to inform users of the specific calculation issue encountered.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that describes the nature of the calculation error. If no message is provided, it defaults to `None`, which is acceptable.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return any value; it initializes the instance of the `CalculationError` class.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by calling the constructor of the parent class using `super().__init__()`, which initializes the base exception class with the provided message. This ensures that the `CalculationError` instance behaves like a standard exception while also carrying additional context specific to calculation errors.
- If a message is provided, it is passed to the parent class, allowing it to be accessed when the exception is raised or printed. If no message is provided, the default behavior of the parent class is utilized. This design allows for flexibility in error reporting while maintaining the integrity of exception handling in Python.
