### CalculationError.__init__(self, message: str)

**Description:**  
The `CalculationError` class is a custom exception that is raised to indicate errors specifically related to calculation processes within the application. The `__init__` method initializes the exception with a custom error message that provides context about the nature of the calculation error.

**Parameters:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that explains the reason for the exception being raised.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `message` parameter should be a non-empty string that clearly describes the calculation error. It is expected to provide sufficient detail to help the user or developer understand the issue.

**Returns:**  
`None`: The method does not return any value, as it is used to initialize the exception object.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `__init__` method of the `CalculationError` class is called when an instance of the exception is created. It takes a single argument, `message`, which is stored as part of the exception instance.
- This method typically calls the parent class's `__init__` method to ensure that the base exception class is properly initialized with the provided message.
- The custom message can then be used when the exception is caught, allowing for more informative error handling and debugging.
- This class does not have any dependencies on other modules or functions, making it a standalone component for error handling in calculation-related contexts.
