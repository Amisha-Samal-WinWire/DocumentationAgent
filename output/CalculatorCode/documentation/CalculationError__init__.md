**Dependencies:**
- `super().__init__`
### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError` class is a custom exception that is raised to indicate errors that occur during calculations within the application. This class extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling related to calculation failures.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class.
- `message` (`str`, optional): A descriptive message that provides details about the error. This message is passed to the base exception class to convey the nature of the calculation error.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that describes the error encountered during a calculation. If no message is provided, the default behavior of the base exception class will apply.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method of the `CalculationError` class calls the `__init__` method of its superclass (the base exception class) using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that the base class is properly initialized with the provided error message.
- By extending the base exception class, `CalculationError` allows developers to raise this specific exception type in their code, facilitating more granular error handling for calculation-related issues. This can be particularly useful in debugging and logging, as it provides context-specific information about the nature of the error encountered.
