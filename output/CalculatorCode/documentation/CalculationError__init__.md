**Dependencies:**
- `super().__init__`
### CalculationError.__init__()

**Description:**
The `CalculationError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors that occur during calculation processes within the application. This class extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling related to calculation failures.

**Parameters:**
- `self`: Represents the instance of the class.
- `message` (`str`, optional): A descriptive message that provides details about the error encountered during the calculation. If not provided, a default message may be used.

**Expected Input:**
- The `message` parameter should be a string that describes the nature of the calculation error. It can be an empty string or omitted, in which case a default message will be used.

**Returns:**
`None`: The constructor does not return any value. It initializes the `CalculationError` instance.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`, which ensures that the base exception class is properly initialized. This allows the `CalculationError` to inherit all the properties and methods of standard exceptions.
- The `message` parameter, if provided, is passed to the superclass constructor, which sets the error message for the exception. This message can then be retrieved when the exception is raised, providing context for the error that occurred during calculations.
- The method does not include any additional logic beyond initializing the superclass, focusing solely on setting up the exception with the appropriate message.
