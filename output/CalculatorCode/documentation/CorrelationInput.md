# Documentation for `CorrelationInput`

### CorrelationInput

**Description:**
`CorrelationInput` is a model class designed to represent and validate the input data for generating a correlation matrix. It ensures that the input data contains at least two columns when specified, thereby enforcing the necessary conditions for correlation analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (the class does not define any parameters or attributes in the provided context).

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects input data structured in a way that allows for correlation analysis, typically in the form of a dataset with multiple columns. If the correlation matrix is to be computed, it is essential that the dataset contains at least two columns.

**Returns:**
None (as a model class, it does not return values upon instantiation).

**Detailed Logic:**
- `CorrelationInput` inherits from the `BaseModel`, leveraging its foundational functionalities while adding specific validation for correlation data.
- The class likely includes validation logic that checks the structure of the input data, specifically ensuring that there are at least two columns present when required.
- It may utilize the `field_validator` function to enforce these validation rules, ensuring that the input data meets the necessary criteria for further processing.
- The class does not directly raise exceptions but may rely on the `ValueError` to signal issues related to invalid input values or structures during the validation process.
- Overall, `CorrelationInput` serves as a specialized model that encapsulates the requirements for preparing data for correlation analysis, promoting data integrity and consistency within the application.
