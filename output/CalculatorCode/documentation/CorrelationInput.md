# Documentation for `CorrelationInput`

### CorrelationInput

**Description:**
`CorrelationInput` is a model class designed to represent and validate the structure of a correlation matrix. It ensures that the input data contains at least two columns when specified, thereby enforcing the necessary conditions for correlation calculations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The class does not define any specific parameters or attributes upon instantiation, as it inherits from `BaseModel`, which serves as a foundational structure for derived models.

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects input data that includes multiple columns, with a minimum requirement of at least two columns if specified. This is crucial for performing correlation analysis, as correlation requires a comparison between at least two variables.

**Returns:**
- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a model for managing and validating correlation matrix data.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `CorrelationInput` inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides a consistent interface and shared behaviors for model instances.
- The class likely utilizes the `field_validator` function to enforce validation rules on the input data, ensuring that the necessary conditions (such as the presence of at least two columns) are met.
- If the validation fails, the class may raise a `ValueError`, indicating that the input does not conform to the expected structure for a correlation matrix.
- The logic within `CorrelationInput` focuses on maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the input is suitable for further processing related to correlation calculations.
