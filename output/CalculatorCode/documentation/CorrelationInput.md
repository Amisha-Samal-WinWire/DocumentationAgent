### CorrelationInput

**Description:**  
The `CorrelationInput` class serves as a model for managing and validating input data for correlation matrix calculations. It ensures that the input data structure contains at least the minimum required number of columns, which is essential for performing correlation analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `min_columns` (`int`): The minimum number of columns required for the correlation analysis. This attribute defines the threshold that the input data must meet.
- `data` (various types, e.g., DataFrame): The internal data structure that holds the input data for correlation analysis. This could be a DataFrame or a similar structure containing the relevant columns.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `CorrelationInput` class expects an internal data structure (such as a DataFrame) that contains the columns to be evaluated for correlation. The specific minimum number of columns required is defined by the `min_columns` attribute. If the data structure does not meet this requirement, the class will raise an error during validation.

**Returns:**  
None

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The class includes a method `check_min_columns`, which is responsible for validating the number of columns in the input data.
- This method assesses the internal data structure to count the number of columns present.
- It then compares this count against the `min_columns` threshold defined in the class.
- If the number of columns is below the required minimum, the method raises an exception or triggers an error handling mechanism, indicating that the input data is insufficient for correlation analysis.
- This validation step is crucial to ensure that subsequent operations can be performed without encountering errors due to inadequate data.
