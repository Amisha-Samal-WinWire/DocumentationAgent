# Documentation for `CorrelationInput`

### CorrelationInput

**Description:**
`CorrelationInput` is a model class designed to represent the input data for generating a correlation matrix. It ensures that the input data contains at least two columns when specified, thereby enforcing a fundamental requirement for correlation analysis.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- None (as it inherits from `BaseModel` and does not define additional parameters).

**Expected Input:**
- The class expects input data structured in a way that allows for the extraction of multiple columns. Specifically, it requires at least two columns to be present if the correlation analysis is to be performed. The exact format of the input data (e.g., DataFrame, list of lists) is not specified, but it must be compatible with the correlation matrix computation.

**Returns:**
None.

**Detailed Logic:**
- `CorrelationInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for the model. The class does not implement its own constructor or methods but relies on the inherited functionality from `BaseModel`.
- The primary validation logic is likely implemented to check the number of columns in the input data. If the input does not meet the requirement of having at least two columns, an appropriate exception (such as `ValueError`) may be raised to indicate the issue.
- The class serves as a specialized model for handling correlation input, ensuring that any data passed to it is suitable for correlation analysis, thereby maintaining data integrity and preventing errors in subsequent calculations.
