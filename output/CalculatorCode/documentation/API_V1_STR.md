# Documentation for `API_V1_STR`

### API_V1_STR

**Description:**
`API_V1_STR` is a constant that represents the version string for the first version of the API. It is typically used in routing and endpoint definitions to ensure that requests are directed to the correct version of the API, facilitating version control and backward compatibility.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This constant does not take any input parameters. It is used as a predefined string value within the codebase.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- `API_V1_STR` serves as a static string that is likely formatted to indicate the version of the API (e.g., "/api/v1"). 
- It is utilized throughout the codebase to construct URLs for API endpoints, ensuring that all requests are consistently routed to the appropriate version.
- By using a constant for the version string, the codebase can easily manage and update the API versioning without the risk of introducing errors in multiple locations. This promotes maintainability and clarity in the API's structure.
