# Documentation for `API_V1_STR`

### API_V1_STR

**Description:**
`API_V1_STR` is a constant string that represents the versioning scheme for the API. It is typically used to define the base path for version 1 of the API endpoints, ensuring that all requests are routed correctly to the appropriate version of the API.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This constant does not accept any input as it is a predefined string value. It is used directly in the codebase wherever the API versioning is required.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- `API_V1_STR` serves as a static reference point for the versioning of the API. By using a constant string, the codebase can maintain consistency across different modules and components that interact with the API.
- The use of a version string allows for easy updates and changes to the API structure without needing to modify multiple instances throughout the code. Instead, any changes to the versioning can be made in one location, promoting maintainability and reducing the risk of errors.
- This constant does not perform any computations or logic; it simply acts as a label for the API version, which can be concatenated with other strings to form complete endpoint URLs.
