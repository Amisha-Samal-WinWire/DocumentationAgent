### calculate_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence_level: float) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given dataset based on a specified confidence level. This function provides a statistical range within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, with a certain degree of confidence.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values representing the sample data for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): A decimal value between 0 and 1 representing the desired confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats, where each float represents a sample observation. The list must contain at least two elements to compute a valid confidence interval.
- `confidence_level` must be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will result in an error.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two float values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure that the `data` list is not empty and that the `confidence_level` is within the acceptable range.
- It calculates the sample mean and standard deviation of the provided data.
- Using the standard error of the mean, it computes the margin of error based on the specified confidence level, typically utilizing the t-distribution for small sample sizes.
- Finally, it constructs the confidence interval by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the sample mean, returning the lower and upper bounds as a tuple.
- This function does not rely on any external modules, but it may utilize basic statistical formulas and properties of distributions.
