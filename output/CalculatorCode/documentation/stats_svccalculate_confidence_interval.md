# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_confidence_interval`

### calculate_confidence_interval() -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given dataset, providing a range within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a specified level of confidence. This function is commonly used in statistical analysis to quantify the uncertainty around a sample estimate.

**Parameters:**
- `None`

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset (not specified in the parameters) that is typically in the form of a list or array of numerical values. The dataset should be representative of the population from which it is drawn.
- The function may also require a confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%), though this is not explicitly stated in the parameters.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two float values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by determining the sample mean and standard deviation of the provided dataset.
- It then calculates the standard error of the mean, which is derived from the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.
- Using the desired confidence level, the function identifies the appropriate critical value from the t-distribution (or z-distribution, depending on the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known).
- Finally, it computes the confidence interval by adding and subtracting the product of the critical value and the standard error from the sample mean, resulting in the lower and upper bounds of the interval.
- This function does not interact with external modules, relying solely on basic statistical calculations.
