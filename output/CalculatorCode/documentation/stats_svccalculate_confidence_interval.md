### calculate_confidence_interval(data: List[float], confidence_level: float) -> Tuple[float, float]

**Description:**
Calculates the confidence interval for a given dataset based on a specified confidence level. This function provides a statistical range that is likely to contain the true population parameter, allowing users to understand the degree of uncertainty associated with their sample estimates.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values representing the sample data for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.
- `confidence_level` (`float`): A decimal value between 0 and 1 representing the desired confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list of floats. The values should be numerical and can include both positive and negative numbers.
- `confidence_level` must be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will result in an error.

**Returns:**
`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure that the `data` list is not empty and that the `confidence_level` is within the acceptable range.
- It calculates the sample mean and standard deviation of the provided data.
- Using the standard error of the mean, it determines the critical value from the t-distribution based on the specified confidence level and the sample size.
- Finally, it computes the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval using the mean, critical value, and standard error, returning these bounds as a tuple. This function does not rely on any external dependencies and utilizes basic statistical formulas to perform its calculations.
