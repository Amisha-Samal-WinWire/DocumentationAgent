### get_z_scores(data: List[float]) -> List[float]

**Description:**
The `get_z_scores` function calculates the Z-scores for a given list of numerical data. Z-scores indicate how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the dataset, providing a way to understand the relative position of each data point within the distribution.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of floating-point numbers for which the Z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- The `data` parameter should be a non-empty list of floats. It is important that the list contains numerical values to ensure valid calculations. If the list is empty or contains non-numeric values, the function may raise an exception.

**Returns:**
`List[float]`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input data. Each Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input data to ensure it is a non-empty list of floats.
- It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the input data using the `calculate_z_scores` method from the `StatsService` class.
- The Z-scores are computed using the formula: \( Z = \frac{(X - \text{mean})}{\text{std\_dev}} \), where \( X \) is each individual data point.
- The results are rounded to four decimal places for precision and returned as a list.
- If any errors occur during the calculation (e.g., division by zero if the standard deviation is zero), the function raises an `APIException` to provide structured error handling, ensuring that the API can return a well-formed JSON error message to the client.

### get_z_scores(data: List[float]) -> List[float]

**Description:**
The `get_z_scores` function is designed to compute the z-scores for a given dataset. A z-score quantifies the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset, thereby providing insight into the relative position of each data point within the distribution. This function is typically used in statistical analysis to identify outliers or to standardize data for further processing.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the z-scores will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `data` should be a non-empty list containing floats or integers. The values can be positive, negative, or zero, but the list must contain at least one element to compute the mean and standard deviation.

**Returns:**
`List[float]`: A list of z-scores corresponding to the input data, where each z-score indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input to ensure that the `data` list is non-empty.
- It then calculates the mean of the dataset by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
- Following this, the standard deviation is computed, which involves calculating the variance (the average of the squared differences from the mean) and taking the square root of that variance.
- For each value in the dataset, the z-score is calculated using the formula: \( z = \frac{(X - \text{mean})}{\text{std\_dev}} \), where \( X \) is the individual data point.
- The resulting z-scores are collected into a list and returned to the caller.
- This function relies on the `stats_svc.calculate_z_scores` method to perform the actual z-score calculations, ensuring that the logic is encapsulated and reusable.
