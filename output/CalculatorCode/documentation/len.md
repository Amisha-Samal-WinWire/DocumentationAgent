# Documentation for `len`

### len(obj: Any) -> int

**Description:**
The `len` function returns the number of items in an object. It is a built-in function in Python that can be used with various data types, including strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. The primary purpose of this function is to provide a simple and efficient way to determine the size or length of a collection or sequence.

**Parameters:**
- `obj` (`Any`): The object whose length is to be determined. This can be any iterable or collection type supported by Python.

**Expected Input:**
- `obj` can be any object that implements the `__len__` method, such as:
  - Strings (e.g., `"hello"`)
  - Lists (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)
  - Tuples (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`)
  - Dictionaries (e.g., `{"key": "value"}`)
  - Sets (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`)
- If the object does not support length measurement, a `TypeError` will be raised.

**Returns:**
`int`: The number of items in the specified object. If the object is empty, it returns `0`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function first checks if the provided object has a defined length by looking for the `__len__` method.
- If the method exists, it calls this method to retrieve the length of the object.
- The result is then returned as an integer value representing the count of items within the object.
- If the object does not support length measurement (i.e., it lacks the `__len__` method), the function raises a `TypeError`, indicating that the object is not of a type that can be measured for length.
- This function operates efficiently and is optimized for performance across various data types, making it a fundamental tool in Python programming.
