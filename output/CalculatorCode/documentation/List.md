# Documentation for `list`

### list

**Description:**
The `list` function is a built-in Python function that creates a new list object. It can be used to initialize an empty list or to create a list from an iterable, such as a string, tuple, or another list. This function is fundamental in Python, as lists are one of the core data structures used to store ordered collections of items.

**Parameters:**
- `iterable` (`iterable`, optional): An optional parameter that can be any iterable object (like a string, tuple, or another list). If provided, the function will create a list containing the elements of the iterable. If not provided, an empty list is created.

**Expected Input:**
- If `iterable` is provided, it should be an object that can be iterated over, such as a list, tuple, string, or any other iterable type. If no argument is passed, the function will create an empty list.

**Returns:**
`list`: A new list object. If an iterable is provided, the list will contain the elements of that iterable. If no argument is provided, an empty list is returned.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When the `list` function is called, it first checks if an argument has been provided.
- If an `iterable` is passed, the function iterates over the elements of the iterable and adds each element to the newly created list.
- If no argument is provided, the function simply initializes and returns an empty list.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates independently, relying solely on the built-in capabilities of Python to handle iterables and list creation.
