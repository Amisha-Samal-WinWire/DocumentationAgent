# Documentation for `list`

### list

**Description:**
The `list` function is a built-in Python function that creates a new list object. It can be used to convert other iterable types (such as tuples, strings, or sets) into a list, or to create an empty list if no arguments are provided. This function is fundamental in Python, as lists are one of the most commonly used data structures for storing ordered collections of items.

**Parameters:**
- `iterable` (`iterable`, optional): An optional parameter that can be any iterable object (e.g., a tuple, string, or set). If provided, the function will convert this iterable into a list. If not provided, an empty list is created.

**Expected Input:**
- If `iterable` is provided, it should be an iterable object. Common examples include:
  - A tuple (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`)
  - A string (e.g., `"hello"`, which would create a list of characters `['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`)
  - A set (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`)
- If no input is given, the function will create an empty list `[]`.

**Returns:**
`list`: A new list object. If an iterable is provided, it contains the elements of that iterable. If no arguments are provided, it returns an empty list.

**Detailed Logic:**
- When the `list` function is called, it first checks if an argument is provided.
- If an `iterable` is given, the function iterates over the elements of the iterable and adds them to a new list.
- If no argument is provided, the function initializes and returns an empty list.
- The `list` function does not have any dependencies on external modules and operates solely on the provided input, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle various iterable types.
