# Documentation for `list`

### list

**Description:**
The `list` function is a built-in Python function that creates a new list object. Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of items. The `list` function can take an iterable as an argument and convert it into a list, allowing for flexible data manipulation and storage.

**Parameters:**
- `iterable` (`iterable`, optional): An optional parameter that can be any iterable object (e.g., a string, tuple, or another list). If provided, the elements of the iterable are added to the new list. If not provided, an empty list is created.

**Expected Input:**
- If `iterable` is provided, it should be an iterable object. This can include types such as strings, tuples, sets, or other lists. If `iterable` is not provided, the function will return an empty list.

**Returns:**
`list`: A new list object containing the elements of the provided iterable, or an empty list if no iterable is given.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `list` function checks if an `iterable` argument is provided. If it is, the function iterates over the elements of the iterable and adds them to a new list.
- If no argument is provided, the function initializes and returns an empty list.
- The resulting list can contain elements of mixed types, as lists in Python are heterogeneous.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates independently, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle various iterable types.
