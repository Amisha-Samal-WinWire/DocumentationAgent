### calculate_present_value(future_value: float, discount_rate: float, periods: int) -> float

**Description:**  
Calculates the present value of an investment based on its future value, the discount rate, and the number of periods until the investment matures. This method is essential for assessing the current worth of an expected future cash flow.

**Parameters:**
- `future_value` (`float`): The amount of money to be received in the future.
- `discount_rate` (`float`): The interest rate used to discount future cash flows to their present value, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
- `periods` (`int`): The number of time periods (e.g., years) until the future value is realized.

**Expected Input:**  
- `future_value` should be a positive float representing the expected amount to be received in the future.
- `discount_rate` should be a non-negative float, where a value of 0.0 indicates no discounting.
- `periods` should be a non-negative integer representing the number of periods until the future value is received.

**Returns:**  
`float`: The present value of the future cash flow, representing how much that future amount is worth in today's terms.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method applies the present value formula, which is derived from the concept of discounting future cash flows. The formula used is:  
  \[ \text{Present Value} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1 + \text{Discount Rate})^{\text{Periods}}} \]
- It first calculates the denominator by raising the sum of one and the discount rate to the power of the number of periods.
- The future value is then divided by this calculated denominator to yield the present value.
- This method does not rely on any external modules or dependencies, performing the calculation using basic arithmetic operations.
