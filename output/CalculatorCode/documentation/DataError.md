### DataError

**Description:**
The `DataError` class is a custom exception designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling related to data integrity or format issues.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The `DataError` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it can accept a message string that describes the error when raised.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- When an instance of `DataError` is created, it calls the constructor of its superclass using `super().__init__()`. This allows it to inherit the properties and methods of the base exception class, ensuring that it behaves like a standard exception while providing additional context specific to data-related errors.
- The class does not implement any additional methods or attributes beyond what is provided by the base exception class, focusing solely on signaling data-related issues within the application.
