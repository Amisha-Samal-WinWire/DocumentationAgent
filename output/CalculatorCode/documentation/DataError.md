### DataError

**Description:**
`DataError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing it to be raised in scenarios where data integrity or validity issues occur, providing a clear mechanism for error handling in data-related operations.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- This class does not take any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is typically raised with a message string that describes the nature of the data error.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataError` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, utilizing `super().__init__` to initialize the base class. This allows it to leverage the standard exception handling mechanisms in Python.
- When an instance of `DataError` is created, it can be raised in the codebase wherever data-related exceptions need to be communicated, providing a clear and specific error type that can be caught and handled appropriately by the calling code.
- The class does not implement additional methods or attributes beyond those inherited from the base `Exception` class, focusing solely on signaling data-related issues.
