### DataError

**Description:**
`DataError` is a custom exception class designed to handle errors related to data processing within the application. It extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling when data-related issues arise.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- **None**: The `DataError` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from its parent class.

**Expected Input:**
- This class is intended to be raised as an exception, typically when there is an issue with data integrity or processing. It does not take any specific input parameters upon instantiation, but it can accept a message string that describes the error.

**Returns:**
- **None**: As an exception class, `DataError` does not return a value. Instead, it serves as a signal that an error has occurred, which can be caught and handled by the calling code.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `DataError` class inherits from the built-in exception class, utilizing the `super().__init__` method to initialize the base class. This allows it to inherit standard exception behavior while providing a specific context for data-related errors.
- When an instance of `DataError` is raised, it can carry a message that provides additional information about the nature of the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.
- The class does not implement any additional methods or properties, relying on the functionality provided by the base exception class to manage error reporting and handling.
