### DataError

**Description:**  
The `DataError` class is a custom exception specifically designed to handle errors that arise during data processing within the application. It provides a mechanism to raise and catch exceptions that are related to data integrity issues, allowing developers to manage errors in a more granular and informative manner.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the data error encountered.

**Expected Input:**  
- The `message` parameter should be a string that conveys the specifics of the error. It is expected to be informative enough to help users or developers understand the context of the error. There are no constraints on the content of the message, but it should be clear and relevant to the data issue being reported.

**Returns:**  
None: The `DataError` class does not return a value; it initializes an instance of the class when raised.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The `DataError` class inherits from a base exception class, allowing it to function as a standard exception while adding custom functionality specific to data-related errors.
- When an instance of `DataError` is created, the `__init__` method is invoked, which takes a `message` parameter. This message is typically passed when raising the exception to provide context about the error.
- The `__init__` method likely calls the parent class's `__init__` method to ensure that the base exception class is properly initialized with the provided message.
- This design allows the `DataError` to encapsulate information about data integrity issues, making it easier for developers to identify and address problems during data processing.
- The class is intended to be raised in scenarios where data integrity issues occur, providing a clear and specific error message to facilitate debugging and error handling.
