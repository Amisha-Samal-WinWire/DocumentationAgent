# Documentation for `app\services\financial_service.py::module_code`

### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as a utility module within the `financial_service.py` file, encapsulating the core functionalities of the `FinancialService` class. It is designed to facilitate various financial calculations, such as determining future values, present values, and periodic payments, by leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The methods within the `FinancialService` class expect inputs that conform to the specifications of the `numpy_financial` functions it utilizes. The expected inputs include:
  - `rate`: A non-negative float representing the interest rate per period.
  - `nper`: A positive integer indicating the total number of payment periods.
  - `pmt`: A float representing the payment amount per period, which can be negative for outgoing payments.
  - `pv`: A float representing the present value, typically non-negative.
  - `fv`: A float representing the future value, which can also be negative.
  - `when`: A string that specifies the timing of payments, either 'end' or 'begin'.

**Returns:**
The methods within the `FinancialService` class return various float values depending on the specific financial calculation being performed. These values represent:
- The future value of an investment after all payments and interest have been applied.
- The present value of a series of future cash flows.
- The fixed periodic payment required to achieve a specified future value.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` encapsulates methods that call the `numpy_financial` library functions to perform financial calculations.
- Each method validates the input parameters to ensure they meet the expected criteria (e.g., non-negative rates, positive number of periods).
- For future value calculations, the class uses `npf.fv`, which computes the future value based on the present value, periodic payments, interest rate, and timing of payments.
- For present value calculations, the class utilizes `npf.pv`, which determines the current worth of future cash flows based on similar parameters.
- To calculate periodic payments, the class employs `npf.pmt`, which derives the fixed payment amount needed to reach a desired future value given a present value and interest rate.
- The class does not rely on any external modules beyond `numpy_financial` and performs calculations using the mathematical operations defined within those functions.
