### module_code

**Description:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
The `module_code` serves as a central point for financial calculations within the `FinancialService` class. It encapsulates the logic necessary to perform various financial computations, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library. This module is designed to streamline the process of executing essential financial calculations, such as future value, present value, and payment calculations, thereby aiding users in financial analysis and planning.
=======
The `module_code` serves as a utility module within the `financial_service.py` file, encapsulating the functionality of the `FinancialService` class. This module is designed to provide essential financial calculations, leveraging the `numpy_financial` library to facilitate various financial analyses, such as calculating future values, present values, and periodic payments associated with loans and investments.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
The methods within the `module_code` expect numerical inputs that represent financial values. These inputs typically include:
- Numeric types (integers or floats) representing monetary values, interest rates, and time periods.
- Positive values for amounts and time periods.
- Interest rates should be expressed as decimals (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).

**Returns:**
The methods within the `module_code` return numerical values (floats) that represent the results of the financial calculations performed. The specific return values depend on the method invoked:
- Future value calculations return the total value of an investment after a specified period.
- Present value calculations return the current worth of a future sum of money.
- Payment calculations return the fixed periodic payment amount required to amortize a loan.

**Detailed Logic:**
The `module_code` utilizes functions from the `numpy_financial` library to perform its calculations:
- **Future Value Calculation**: It employs the `npf.fv` function to compute the future value of an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate. The method typically requires inputs such as the interest rate, number of periods, and payment amount.
- **Present Value Calculation**: The `npf.pv` function is used to determine the present value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows, given a specified rate of return. The method requires inputs like the future value, interest rate, and number of periods.
- **Payment Calculation**: The `npf.pmt` function calculates the fixed periodic payment required to fully amortize a loan based on the principal, interest rate, and number of payments. The corresponding method takes inputs such as the principal amount, interest rate, and total number of payments.

Overall, the `module_code` acts as a facilitator for executing essential financial calculations, ensuring accurate results through the use of established financial formulas and providing a user-friendly interface for financial analysis.
=======
- The methods within the `FinancialService` class expect input parameters that align with the requirements of the `numpy_financial` functions it utilizes. The following constraints apply:
  - Interest rates must be non-negative floats.
  - The number of periods (`nper`) must be a positive integer.
  - Payment amounts (`pmt`) should be floats, which can be negative if they represent cash outflows.
  - Present values (`pv`) and future values (`fv`) are optional floats, typically representing monetary amounts.
  - The timing of payments (`when`) should be a string, either 'end' or 'begin'.

**Returns:**
The methods of the `FinancialService` class return various float values, depending on the specific financial calculation being performed. These values represent key financial metrics such as future value, present value, or periodic payment amounts.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `module_code` encapsulates methods that call the `numpy_financial` functions to perform financial calculations. Each method is designed to validate its input parameters to ensure they meet the expected types and constraints before proceeding with calculations.
- For future value calculations, the module utilizes the `npf.fv` function, which computes the future value of an investment based on periodic payments and a constant interest rate.
- For present value calculations, it employs the `npf.pv` function to determine the current worth of future cash flows, discounted at the specified interest rate.
- To calculate periodic payments, the module uses the `npf.pmt` function, which derives the fixed payment amount required to amortize a loan or investment over a specified number of periods.
- The module does not maintain any internal state or attributes, focusing solely on providing utility methods for financial computations. Each method operates independently, relying on the input parameters provided by the user.
