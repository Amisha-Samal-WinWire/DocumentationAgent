### FinancialService

**Description:**
The `FinancialService` class provides a set of methods for performing common financial calculations, leveraging the capabilities of the `numpy_financial` library. It is designed to facilitate calculations related to future value, present value, and periodic payments for loans, making it a useful tool for financial analysis and planning.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None (the class does not have any attributes).

**Expected Input:**
- The methods within this class expect numerical inputs:
  - `rate`: A float representing the interest rate (expressed as a decimal).
  - `nper`: An integer indicating the total number of payment periods.
  - `pmt`: A float representing the payment made each period (for future and present value calculations).
  - `pv`: A float representing the present value (the initial amount of money).
  - `fv`: A float representing the future value (the amount of money to be received in the future).

**Returns:**
- Each method returns a `float` representing the calculated financial value:
  - `calculate_future_value`: Returns the future value of an investment.
  - `calculate_present_value`: Returns the present value of an investment.
  - `calculate_payment`: Returns the periodic payment amount for a loan.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `FinancialService` class contains three primary methods:
  1. **calculate_future_value**: This method computes the future value of an investment based on the provided interest rate, number of periods, periodic payment, and present value. It utilizes the `fv` function from the `numpy_financial` library to perform the calculation.
  
  2. **calculate_present_value**: This method calculates the present value of an investment given the interest rate, number of periods, periodic payment, and future value. It employs the `pv` function from the `numpy_financial` library to derive the present value.
  
  3. **calculate_payment**: This method determines the periodic payment required to amortize a loan over a specified number of periods, using the provided interest rate and present value. It calls the `pmt` function from the `numpy_financial` library to compute the payment amount.

- Each method is designed to handle standard financial formulas, ensuring accurate calculations based on the inputs provided. The class does not maintain any state or attributes, making it stateless and suitable for use in various financial computation scenarios.
