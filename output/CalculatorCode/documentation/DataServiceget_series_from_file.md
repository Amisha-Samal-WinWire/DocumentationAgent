### DataService.get_series_from_file(file: UploadFile, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a CSV file provided as an `UploadFile`, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series. This method is useful for processing data files uploaded by users, allowing for easy access to specific data columns for further analysis or manipulation.

**Parameters:**
- `file` (`UploadFile`): An object representing the uploaded CSV file. This should be a valid CSV format that can be read by pandas.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to be extracted from the CSV file. This should match one of the column headers in the CSV.

**Expected Input:**
- The `file` parameter must be a valid `UploadFile` object containing CSV data.
- The `column_name` should be a string that corresponds to an existing column in the CSV file. If the specified column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column of the CSV file. If the column is not found, a `DataError` will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by reading the contents of the provided CSV file using the `pd.read_csv` function, which loads the data into a pandas DataFrame.
- It then checks if the specified `column_name` exists within the DataFrame's columns. If the column is found, it extracts the data from that column and converts it into a pandas Series.
- If the column does not exist, the method raises a `DataError`, indicating that the requested column could not be found in the uploaded file.
- This method leverages the capabilities of the pandas library for data manipulation and the `DataError` class for error handling, ensuring that users receive clear feedback when issues arise during data extraction.

### DataService.get_series_from_file(filepath: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a CSV file from the specified file path, extracts the data from a specified column, and returns it as a Pandas Series. This method is useful for data processing tasks where specific columns from CSV files need to be analyzed or manipulated.

**Parameters:**
- `filepath` (`str`): The path to the CSV file that contains the data to be read.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column from which the data will be extracted.

**Expected Input:**
- `filepath` should be a valid string representing the path to an accessible CSV file. The file must be in a readable format.
- `column_name` should be a string that matches one of the column names in the CSV file. If the specified column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A Pandas Series containing the data from the specified column of the CSV file. Each entry in the Series corresponds to a row in the specified column.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by using the `pd.read_csv` function to read the contents of the CSV file located at the provided `filepath`. This function parses the CSV and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- After loading the DataFrame, the method checks if the specified `column_name` exists within the DataFrame's columns.
- If the column exists, the method extracts the data from that column and returns it as a Pandas Series.
- If the column does not exist, the method raises a `DataError`, signaling that the requested data could not be retrieved due to an invalid column name.
- This method relies on the Pandas library for data manipulation and the custom `DataError` exception for error handling, ensuring robust data processing.
