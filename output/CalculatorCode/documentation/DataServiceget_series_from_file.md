### DataService.get_series_from_file(file_path: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**  
Reads a CSV file from the specified file path, extracts the values from a designated column, and returns those values as a pandas Series. This method is useful for data processing tasks where specific column data needs to be isolated for analysis or manipulation.

**Parameters:**
- `file_path` (`str`): The path to the CSV file that needs to be read.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column from which to extract data.

**Expected Input:**  
- `file_path` should be a valid string representing the location of a CSV file on the filesystem. The file must exist and be accessible.
- `column_name` should be a string that matches one of the column headers in the CSV file. If the column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**  
`pd.Series`: A pandas Series containing the values from the specified column of the CSV file. If the column is empty or the file is not formatted correctly, an error may occur.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method begins by attempting to read the CSV file located at the provided `file_path` using pandas' built-in functionality.
- It checks for the existence of the specified `column_name` within the DataFrame created from the CSV file. If the column is not found, it raises a `DataError` with a relevant message.
- Upon successfully locating the column, the method extracts its data and converts it into a pandas Series, which is then returned to the caller.
- This method is designed to handle typical data integrity issues by leveraging the `DataError` exception, ensuring that any problems encountered during the file reading or column extraction process are communicated effectively to the user.
