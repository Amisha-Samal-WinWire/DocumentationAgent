### DataService.get_series_from_file(filepath: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a specified CSV file, extracts a designated column, and returns the data from that column as a Pandas Series. This method is useful for quickly accessing and manipulating a single column of data from a larger dataset stored in a CSV format.

**Parameters:**
- `filepath` (`str`): The path to the CSV file from which data will be read. This should be a valid file path that points to an accessible CSV file.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column to be extracted from the CSV file. This should match one of the column headers in the CSV.

**Expected Input:**
- The `filepath` must point to a valid CSV file that exists on the filesystem.
- The `column_name` should correspond to an existing column in the CSV file. If the column does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A Pandas Series containing the data from the specified column in the CSV file. If the column is not found, an exception will be raised.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by attempting to read the CSV file using the `pd.read_csv` function from the Pandas library. This function processes the file and loads its contents into a DataFrame.
- After successfully loading the data, the method checks for the specified `column_name` within the DataFrame's columns.
- If the column exists, the method extracts the data from that column and returns it as a Pandas Series.
- If the column does not exist, the method raises a `DataError`, which is a custom exception designed to handle data-related issues, providing a clear indication of the problem encountered during the data extraction process.
- The method relies on the proper functioning of the `pd.read_csv` function, which handles various aspects of reading CSV files, including parsing and data type inference.
