### DataService.get_series_from_file(filepath: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series

**Description:**
The `get_series_from_file` method reads a CSV file from the specified file path, extracts the data from a specified column, and returns that data as a Pandas Series. This method is useful for data extraction tasks where specific columns from CSV files need to be processed and analyzed.

**Parameters:**
- `filepath` (`str`): The path to the CSV file that contains the data to be read.
- `column_name` (`str`): The name of the column from which the data should be extracted.

**Expected Input:**
- `filepath` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing CSV file. The file must be accessible and readable.
- `column_name` should be a valid string that matches one of the column names in the CSV file. If the column name does not exist, an error will be raised.

**Returns:**
`pd.Series`: A Pandas Series containing the values from the specified column of the CSV file. Each entry in the Series corresponds to a row in the specified column.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by attempting to read the CSV file using the `pd.read_csv` function, which parses the file into a DataFrame.
- It checks if the specified `column_name` exists within the DataFrame's columns. If the column is found, it extracts the data from that column.
- The extracted data is then returned as a Pandas Series.
- If the file cannot be read or the specified column does not exist, the method raises a `DataError` to signal the issue, ensuring that errors related to data processing are handled appropriately. This allows for robust error management in data extraction workflows.
