# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_descriptive_stats`

### calculate_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
Calculates descriptive statistics for a given dataset, providing insights into its central tendency, variability, and distribution. This function is typically used in data analysis to summarize key characteristics of the data, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, which is typically a list or array of numerical values. The dataset should not be empty and should contain numerical data types (integers or floats). Special cases include handling datasets with missing values or outliers, which may affect the calculated statistics.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, including but not limited to:
- `mean`: The average value of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value when the dataset is sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation, indicating the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
- `range`: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it is not empty and contains valid numerical values.
- It then computes the mean by summing all values and dividing by the count of values.
- The median is calculated by sorting the dataset and finding the middle value, accounting for both odd and even lengths of the dataset.
- The mode is determined by identifying the value(s) that appear most frequently in the dataset.
- The standard deviation is calculated using the formula that measures the dispersion of the dataset from the mean.
- Finally, the range is computed by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the dataset.
- The results are compiled into a dictionary and returned, providing a comprehensive summary of the dataset's descriptive statistics. 

This function does not rely on any external dependencies, making it self-contained for performing statistical analysis on the provided dataset.
