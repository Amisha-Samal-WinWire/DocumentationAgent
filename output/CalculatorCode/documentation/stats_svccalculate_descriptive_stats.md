# Documentation for `stats_svc.calculate_descriptive_stats`

### calculate_descriptive_stats() -> dict

**Description:**
Calculates descriptive statistics for a given dataset. This function aggregates key statistical measures, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range, providing a comprehensive overview of the data's distribution and central tendency.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically in the form of a list or array of numerical values. The dataset should not be empty, and it should contain only numerical data types (integers or floats). Special cases include handling of NaN values or non-numeric entries, which may require preprocessing before invoking this function.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics, including:
- `mean`: The average of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value when the dataset is sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation, indicating the dispersion of the dataset.
- `data_range`: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it is non-empty and contains valid numerical values.
- It computes the mean by summing all values and dividing by the count of values.
- The median is determined by sorting the dataset and finding the middle value, with special handling for even-sized datasets.
- The mode is calculated by identifying the value(s) that appear most frequently, which may involve using a frequency distribution.
- The standard deviation is computed to assess the variability of the dataset, typically using the formula that involves the mean and the squared differences from the mean.
- Finally, the function calculates the range by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.
- The results are compiled into a dictionary and returned, providing a structured summary of the descriptive statistics for further analysis or reporting.
