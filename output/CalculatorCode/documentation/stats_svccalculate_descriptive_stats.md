### calculate_descriptive_stats() 

**Description:**
The `calculate_descriptive_stats` function is designed to compute and return various descriptive statistics for a given dataset. Descriptive statistics provide a summary of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution, which can include metrics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function expects a dataset, typically in the form of a list, array, or similar structure containing numerical values. The dataset should not be empty, as this would lead to undefined statistical measures.

**Returns:**
`dict`: A dictionary containing the calculated descriptive statistics. The keys of the dictionary may include:
- `mean`: The average of the dataset.
- `median`: The middle value when the dataset is sorted.
- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
- `standard_deviation`: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
- `variance`: The square of the standard deviation, representing the degree of spread in the dataset.
- `min`: The smallest value in the dataset.
- `max`: The largest value in the dataset.
- `quartiles`: Values that divide the dataset into four equal parts.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input dataset to ensure it is not empty and contains valid numerical data.
- It then calculates the mean by summing all values and dividing by the count of values.
- The median is determined by sorting the dataset and finding the middle value, with special handling for even-sized datasets.
- The mode is computed by identifying the value(s) that appear most frequently in the dataset.
- The standard deviation and variance are calculated using the appropriate statistical formulas, which involve the mean and the differences between each data point and the mean.
- Finally, the function determines the minimum and maximum values by scanning through the dataset, and it computes the quartiles to provide insights into the distribution of the data.
- The results are compiled into a dictionary and returned to the caller, allowing for easy access to the various statistics. 

This function does not rely on any external dependencies, making it a self-contained utility for statistical analysis.
