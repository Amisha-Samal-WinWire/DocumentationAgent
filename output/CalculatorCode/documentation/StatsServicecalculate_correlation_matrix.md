# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_correlation_matrix`

### calculate_correlation_matrix(self) -> DataFrame

**Description:**
Calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for specified columns in the dataset using the DataService. This method is essential for identifying relationships between different variables in the dataset, providing insights into how they correlate with one another.

**Parameters:**
None.

**Expected Input:**
- The method operates on a dataset that has been previously loaded into the application context via the `_load_data` function. The dataset should be structured as a DataFrame containing numerical columns for which the correlation matrix is to be computed.
- It is assumed that the DataFrame has sufficient rows to yield meaningful correlation results.

**Returns:**
`DataFrame`: A DataFrame representing the Pearson correlation coefficients between each pair of specified columns. The values in the matrix range from -1 to 1, where:
- `1` indicates a perfect positive correlation,
- `-1` indicates a perfect negative correlation,
- `0` indicates no correlation.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by invoking the `_load_data` function to ensure that the most current dataset is available for analysis.
- It then calls the `df.corr()` function on the loaded DataFrame to compute the pairwise correlation coefficients for the specified columns.
- The resulting correlation matrix is constructed as a square DataFrame, where both the rows and columns correspond to the original DataFrame's columns, and each cell contains the correlation coefficient for the respective column pair.
- Finally, the method returns the correlation matrix, allowing for further analysis and interpretation of the relationships between the variables in the dataset. This process does not involve any external dependencies beyond the DataFrame operations.
