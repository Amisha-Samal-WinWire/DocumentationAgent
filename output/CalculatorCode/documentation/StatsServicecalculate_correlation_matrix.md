### StatsService.calculate_correlation_matrix(columns: List[str]) -> pd.DataFrame

**Description:**  
Calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns in a dataset. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear correlation between two variables, providing insights into how changes in one variable may relate to changes in another.

**Parameters:**
- `columns` (`List[str]`): A list of column names for which the correlation matrix will be computed.

**Expected Input:**  
- `columns` should be a list of strings, each representing the name of a column in a dataset (e.g., a DataFrame). The specified columns must exist within the dataset, and they should contain numerical data to compute the correlation.

**Returns:**  
`pd.DataFrame`: A DataFrame representing the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns, where each cell (i, j) contains the correlation coefficient between the i-th and j-th columns.

**Detailed Logic:**  
- The method begins by validating the input to ensure that the specified columns exist within the dataset.
- It then extracts the data corresponding to the specified columns.
- Using the Pearson correlation formula, it computes the correlation coefficients for all pairs of specified columns.
- The resulting correlation coefficients are organized into a DataFrame, which is returned to the caller.
- This method does not rely on any external dependencies and operates solely on the provided column data.
