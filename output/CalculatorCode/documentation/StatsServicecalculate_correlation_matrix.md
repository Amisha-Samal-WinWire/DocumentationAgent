### calculate_correlation_matrix(self, columns: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]

**Description:**
Calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns of a dataset. This method analyzes the linear relationship between pairs of columns, providing insights into how closely related the data points are across the selected features.

**Parameters:**
- `columns` (`List[str]`): A list of strings representing the names of the columns for which the correlation matrix will be calculated.

**Expected Input:**
- `columns` should be a non-empty list of strings, where each string corresponds to a valid column name in the dataset. The dataset must contain numerical data in these columns to compute the correlation.

**Returns:**
`Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]`: A nested dictionary representing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the specified columns. The outer dictionary's keys are the column names, and the values are dictionaries where each key is another column name and the value is the correlation coefficient.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by invoking `self._load_data`, which is responsible for loading the dataset into a DataFrame. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis.
- Once the data is loaded, the method utilizes the `corr` function from the DataFrame to compute the correlation matrix specifically for the columns provided in the input list.
- The resulting correlation matrix is then transformed into a dictionary format using the `to_dict` method, making it easier to access and interpret the correlation values.
- The final output is a structured dictionary that allows users to quickly identify the correlation between each pair of specified columns, facilitating further data analysis and decision-making.

### StatsService.calculate_correlation_matrix(columns: list) -> DataFrame

**Description:**
Calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns in the dataset. This method assesses the linear relationships between the selected variables, providing insights into how they correlate with one another.

**Parameters:**
- `columns` (`list`): A list of strings representing the names of the columns for which the correlation matrix is to be computed. These columns must exist in the dataset loaded by the service.

**Expected Input:**
- The `columns` parameter should contain valid column names that are present in the DataFrame loaded by the `_load_data` method. The specified columns should contain numerical data, as non-numeric columns will not be included in the correlation computation.

**Returns:**
`DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the specified columns. The resulting matrix is symmetric, with diagonal elements equal to 1, indicating perfect correlation of each column with itself.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by invoking the `_load_data` function to load the necessary dataset into the application. This step ensures that the most current data is used for correlation analysis.
- After loading the data, the method checks if the specified columns are present in the DataFrame. If any columns are missing, appropriate error handling should be implemented (though specifics are not detailed in this documentation).
- The method then utilizes the `df.corr()` function to compute the correlation matrix for the specified columns. This function calculates the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients, which measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the columns.
- Finally, the resulting correlation matrix is returned as a DataFrame, allowing users to easily interpret the relationships between the selected variables. This matrix can be used for further analysis or visualization as needed.
