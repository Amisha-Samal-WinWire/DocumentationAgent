# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_correlation_matrix`

### calculate_correlation_matrix(self, columns: list) -> DataFrame

**Description:**
Calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for specified columns in a dataset using the DataService. This method is essential for understanding the linear relationships between different variables in the dataset, providing insights into how changes in one variable may affect another.

**Parameters:**
- `columns` (`list`): A list of strings representing the names of the columns for which the correlation matrix will be calculated. These columns must exist in the loaded dataset.

**Expected Input:**
- The `columns` parameter should contain valid column names that are present in the dataset. The dataset must be loaded prior to invoking this method, typically through the `_load_data` function. The specified columns should contain numerical data to ensure meaningful correlation calculations.

**Returns:**
`DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the specified columns. The index and columns of the returned DataFrame will correspond to the specified columns, allowing for easy interpretation of the correlation relationships.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The method begins by invoking the `_load_data` function to ensure that the most current dataset is available for analysis. This step is crucial as it prepares the data for subsequent operations.
- After loading the data, the method checks if the specified columns are present in the dataset. If any column is missing, appropriate error handling should be implemented (though specifics are not detailed in this documentation).
- It then utilizes the `df.corr()` function to compute the Pearson correlation matrix for the specified columns. This function calculates the pairwise correlation coefficients, excluding any NA/null values.
- Finally, the resulting correlation matrix is returned as a DataFrame, providing a structured representation of the relationships between the specified columns. This output can be used for further analysis or visualization.
