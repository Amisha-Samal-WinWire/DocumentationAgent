# Documentation for `isnull`

### isnull() -> bool

**Description:**
The `isnull` function is designed to determine whether a given input is null or not. It serves as a utility to check for the absence of a value, which is particularly useful in data processing and validation scenarios.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The function can accept various data types, including but not limited to integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, and custom objects. The primary focus is to identify if the input is equivalent to a null value (e.g., `None` in Python).

**Returns:**
`bool`: The function returns `True` if the input is null (i.e., `None`), and `False` otherwise.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function evaluates the input against the null value (`None`).
- If the input matches `None`, it returns `True`, indicating that the value is indeed null.
- If the input does not match `None`, it returns `False`, indicating that a valid value is present.
- This function does not rely on any external dependencies and performs a straightforward comparison to achieve its purpose.
