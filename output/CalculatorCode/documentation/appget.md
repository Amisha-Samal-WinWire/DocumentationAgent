# Documentation for `app.get`

### app.get

**Description:**
The `app.get` function is a method used to define a route handler for HTTP GET requests in a web application framework. It allows developers to specify a callback function that will be executed when a GET request is made to a particular endpoint. This is essential for creating RESTful APIs and serving web pages.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The URL path for which the GET request handler is defined. This string should start with a forward slash (e.g., `/api/data`).
- `handler` (`Callable`): A callback function that takes in request and response objects as parameters. This function contains the logic to handle the incoming request and send back a response.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a valid string representing the endpoint of the application. It must conform to the routing conventions of the framework being used.
- `handler` should be a callable function that accepts at least two arguments: the request object (which contains information about the HTTP request) and the response object (which is used to send a response back to the client).

**Returns:**
`None`: The function does not return any value. Instead, it registers the handler for the specified path within the application.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The `app.get` function begins by validating the provided `path` to ensure it is a properly formatted string.
- It then registers the `handler` function in the application's routing table, associating it with the specified `path`.
- When a GET request is received at the defined path, the web framework invokes the registered `handler`, passing in the request and response objects.
- The `handler` processes the request, which may involve querying a database, performing business logic, or rendering a view, and ultimately sends a response back to the client.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates within the context of the web application framework's routing system.
