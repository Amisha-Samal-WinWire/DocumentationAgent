# Documentation for `app.get`

### app.get

**Description:**
The `app.get` function is part of a web application framework that handles HTTP GET requests. It is designed to define routes within the application, allowing the server to respond to client requests for specific resources. When a client makes a GET request to a specified endpoint, this function processes the request and returns the appropriate response based on the defined logic.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The URL path for which the GET request handler is defined. This string specifies the endpoint that clients will use to access the resource.
- `handler` (`Callable`): A function that will be invoked when a GET request is made to the specified path. This function is responsible for processing the request and generating the response.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a valid string representing the endpoint, typically starting with a forward slash (e.g., `/api/data`).
- `handler` should be a callable function that accepts the request and response objects, allowing it to handle the incoming request and send back a response.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return a value. Instead, it registers the handler for the specified path within the application, enabling the server to respond to incoming GET requests.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the provided `path` to ensure it is a properly formatted string.
- It then associates the `handler` function with the specified `path` in the application's routing table.
- When a GET request is received at the defined path, the application framework invokes the registered `handler`, passing in the request and response objects.
- The `handler` processes the request, which may involve querying a database, performing business logic, or generating dynamic content, and then sends the appropriate response back to the client.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates independently within the context of the web application framework.
