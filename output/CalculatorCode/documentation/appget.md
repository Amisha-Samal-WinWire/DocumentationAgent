# Documentation for `app.get`

### app.get

**Description:**
The `app.get` function is part of a web application framework that handles HTTP GET requests. It is used to define a route in the application that responds to GET requests, allowing the server to serve resources or data to clients. This function typically maps a specific URL path to a handler function that processes the request and returns a response.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (`str`): The URL path that the GET request should match. This is a string that defines the endpoint for the route.
- `handler` (`Callable`): A function that will be called when a GET request is made to the specified path. This function is responsible for processing the request and generating a response.

**Expected Input:**
- `path` should be a valid URL path string, which may include parameters or wildcards depending on the routing capabilities of the framework.
- `handler` should be a callable function that accepts the request object and returns a response object. The handler function may also accept additional parameters based on the framework's design.

**Returns:**
`None`: This function does not return a value. Instead, it registers the route and handler within the application, allowing the framework to route incoming GET requests appropriately.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the provided `path` to ensure it conforms to expected URL patterns.
- It then registers the `handler` function in an internal routing table, associating it with the specified `path`.
- When a GET request is received at the defined path, the framework invokes the registered handler function, passing the request object as an argument.
- The handler processes the request, potentially interacting with databases or other services, and generates a response.
- The response is then sent back to the client, completing the request-response cycle.
- This function does not have any internal dependencies and relies on the framework's routing mechanism to manage incoming requests.
