# Documentation for `np.sum`

### np.sum(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, dtype: Optional[Dtype] = None, out: Optional[ndarray] = None, keepdims: bool = False) -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `np.sum` function computes the sum of array elements over a specified axis or axes. It can handle multi-dimensional arrays and provides flexibility in terms of data types and output formatting. This function is part of the NumPy library, which is widely used for numerical computations in Python.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or object that can be converted to an array. This is the data whose elements will be summed.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis or axes along which the sums are computed. By default, the sum is computed over all elements in the array. If an axis is specified, the sum is computed along that axis.
- `dtype` (`Optional[Dtype]`): The data type to use for the output array. If not specified, the data type of the input array is used.
- `out` (`Optional[ndarray]`): An alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have the same shape as the expected output.
- `keepdims` (`bool`, default: `False`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the output array with a size of one. This allows for easier broadcasting of the result with the original array.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `a` can be any array-like structure, such as lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays. It can be of any shape and dimension.
- The `axis` parameter should be an integer or a tuple of integers, specifying the axes along which to sum. If `None`, the sum is computed over the entire array.
- The `dtype` parameter should be a valid NumPy data type if specified.
- The `out` parameter, if provided, must be an array of the same shape as the expected output.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: The sum of the array elements along the specified axis or axes. The shape of the output array depends on the `keepdims` parameter.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input array `a` and converting it to a NumPy array if it is not already.
- It checks the specified `axis` to determine how to aggregate the data. If `axis` is `None`, it sums all elements in the array.
- The function then computes the sum using efficient internal algorithms optimized for performance, leveraging NumPy's capabilities.
- If a specific `dtype` is provided, the function ensures that the summation is performed using that data type, which can help prevent overflow in cases of large sums.
- The result is stored in the `out` parameter if provided; otherwise, a new array is created.
- Finally, if `keepdims` is set to `True`, the output retains the dimensions of the input array, allowing for consistent shapes when performing further operations.
