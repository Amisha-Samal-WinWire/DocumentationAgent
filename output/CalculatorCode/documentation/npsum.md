# Documentation for `np.sum`

### np.sum(a: array_like, axis: Optional[int] = None, dtype: Optional[type] = None, out: Optional[array] = None, keepdims: bool = False) -> ndarray

**Description:**
The `np.sum` function computes the sum of array elements over a specified axis or axes. It can handle multi-dimensional arrays and provides flexibility in terms of data types and output formats. This function is part of the NumPy library, which is widely used for numerical computations in Python.

**Parameters:**
- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or object that can be converted to an array. This is the data whose elements will be summed.
- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis or axes along which to perform the summation. If not specified, the sum is computed over all elements in the array.
- `dtype` (`Optional[type]`): The data type to use for the output array. If not specified, the data type of the input array is used.
- `out` (`Optional[array]`): An alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have a shape that matches the expected output.
- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the output as dimensions with size one. This can be useful for broadcasting.

**Expected Input:**
- The input `a` can be any array-like structure, including lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays. It can be of any numerical type (integers, floats, etc.).
- The `axis` parameter should be an integer or a tuple of integers, specifying the axes along which to sum. If `None`, the sum is computed over the entire array.
- The `dtype` parameter should be a valid NumPy data type if specified.
- The `out` parameter should be a NumPy array of the appropriate shape if provided.
- The `keepdims` parameter should be a boolean value.

**Returns:**
`ndarray`: The sum of the array elements, with the same shape as the input array, except for the dimensions along the specified axes which are removed unless `keepdims` is set to `True`.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function begins by validating the input array `a` and converting it to a NumPy array if it is not already one.
- It checks the specified `axis` to determine the dimensions along which to perform the summation.
- If `dtype` is provided, the function ensures that the summation is performed using this data type, which can help prevent overflow or underflow in calculations.
- The summation is then performed using efficient internal algorithms optimized for performance, leveraging NumPy's capabilities for handling large datasets.
- If the `out` parameter is provided, the result is stored in this array; otherwise, a new array is created for the result.
- Finally, if `keepdims` is set to `True`, the function reshapes the output to retain the dimensions of the input array, ensuring compatibility for further operations.
