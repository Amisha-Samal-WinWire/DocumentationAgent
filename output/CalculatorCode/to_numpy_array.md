# Documentation for `to_numpy_array`

```python
def to_numpy_array(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Convert the internal matrix representation to a NumPy array.

    This helper function allows services to retrieve a NumPy array 
    directly from the validated input stored in the object's matrix 
    attribute. It is particularly useful for numerical computations 
    that require the use of NumPy's array functionalities.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A NumPy array representation of the internal matrix.
    """
    return np.array(self.matrix)
``` 

### Documentation Breakdown:

- **Function Name:** `to_numpy_array`
- **Category:** Function
- **File Path:** `Calculator/app/models/calculator.py`
- **Return Type:** `np.ndarray`

### Description:
The `to_numpy_array` function is designed to convert the internal matrix representation of an object into a NumPy array. This conversion facilitates numerical operations that leverage NumPy's efficient array handling capabilities.

### Usage:
This function can be called by other services within the application that require access to the matrix data in the form of a NumPy array. It ensures that the data is validated and ready for further processing.

### Return Value:
The function returns a NumPy array (`np.ndarray`), which is a direct representation of the object's internal matrix attribute.
