# Documentation for `MatrixInput`

```python
class MatrixInput:
    """
    Model for matrix operations.

    The `MatrixInput` class is designed to handle matrix operations, ensuring that 
    the matrices are validated and can be converted to a format suitable for numerical 
    computations. It includes validators to enforce matrix properties and a helper 
    function to facilitate integration with NumPy.

    Attributes:
        matrix (list of list): The internal representation of the matrix, stored as 
                                a list of lists.

    Methods:
        matrix_must_be_square(cls, v):
            Validates that the provided matrix is square (same number of rows and columns).
        
        to_numpy_array() -> np.ndarray:
            Converts the internal matrix representation to a NumPy array for numerical operations.

    Example:
        >>> matrix_input = MatrixInput([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        >>> matrix_input.to_numpy_array()
        array([[1, 2],
               [3, 4]])

    @classmethod
    def matrix_must_be_square(cls, v):
        """
        Validates that the provided matrix is square.

        A square matrix is defined as a matrix with the same number of rows and columns.
        This function checks if the input matrix is empty and raises a ValueError if it is.
        It then verifies that each row in the matrix has the same length as the number of rows.

        Args:
            cls: The class that calls this method (typically used for class methods).
            v (list of list): The matrix to be validated, represented as a list of lists.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the matrix is empty or if the number of rows does not equal
                        the number of columns.

        Returns:
            list of list: The validated square matrix.

        Example:
            >>> matrix_must_be_square(None, [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
            [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

            >>> matrix_must_be_square(None, [[1, 2], [3]])
            ValueError: Matrix must be square (same number of rows and columns).

        Convert the internal matrix representation to a NumPy array.

        This helper function allows services to retrieve a NumPy array 
        directly from the validated input stored in the object's matrix 
        attribute. It is particularly useful for numerical computations 
        that require the use of NumPy's array functionalities.

### Documentation Breakdown:

- **Class Name:** `MatrixInput`
- **Category:** Class
- **File Path:** `Calculator/app/models/calculator.py`

### Description:
The `MatrixInput` class serves as a model for performing matrix operations. It ensures that matrices are validated to be square and provides a method to convert the matrix into a NumPy array for further numerical computations. 

### Attributes:
- **matrix (list of list):** Stores the internal representation of the matrix.

### Methods:
- **matrix_must_be_square(cls, v):** Validates that the provided matrix is square.
- **to_numpy_array() -> np.ndarray:** Converts the internal matrix representation to a NumPy array.

### Example Usage:
```python
matrix_input = MatrixInput([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
numpy_array = matrix_input.to_numpy_array()
```

### Return Value:
The `to_numpy_array` method returns a NumPy array (`np.ndarray`), which is a direct representation of the object's internal matrix attribute, ready for numerical operations.
