    "documentation": "```markdown\n### DataService\n\n**Description:**  \nThe `DataService` class serves as a utility for loading data into pandas objects from various sources, including files and databases. It provides methods to read data from CSV files and SQLite databases, facilitating data manipulation and analysis within the application.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**  \nNone (the class does not have any attributes defined in the provided context).\n\n**Expected Input:**  \n- The methods within the `DataService` class expect valid file paths for CSV files and established SQLite database connections. \n- For methods that retrieve data from a CSV file, the `file_path` must point to an accessible CSV file, and the `column_name` must correspond to an existing column header in that file.\n- For methods that interact with a SQLite database, the `table_name` and `column_name` must match existing entities in the database.\n\n**Returns:**  \n- The methods return pandas objects: either a `pandas.DataFrame` or a `pd.Series`, depending on the method invoked. \n- If the specified data cannot be retrieved due to issues such as non-existent files, columns, or tables, a `DataError` may be raised.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**  \n- The `DataService` class includes several key methods:\n  - `get_dataframe_from_sqlite`: This method connects to a SQLite database and retrieves an entire table, returning it as a pandas DataFrame. It executes a SQL query to select all records from a predefined table and handles any connection or retrieval errors by raising a `DataError`.\n  \n  - `get_series_from_file`: This method reads a CSV file from a specified path, extracts data from a designated column, and returns it as a pandas Series. It checks for the existence of the specified column and raises a `DataError` if the column is not found or if the file is improperly formatted.\n  \n  - `get_series_from_sqlite`: This method retrieves data from a specified column in a SQLite database table and returns it as a pandas Series. It constructs a SQL query to select all entries from the specified column and raises a `DataError` if the column or table does not exist.\n\n- Each method is designed to handle typical data integrity issues and relies on the pandas library for efficient data manipulation. The class is structured to provide a seamless interface for data retrieval, ensuring that users can easily access and work with data stored in various formats.\n```",

    "documentation": "```markdown\n### ValidationService\n\n**Description:**  \nThe `ValidationService` class is designed to perform complex validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid against the actual data stored in the database. This service is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors during data processing.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `data_service` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class that the `ValidationService` relies on for data operations during validation tasks.\n\n**Expected Input:**  \n- The `data_service` parameter must be a properly initialized instance of the `DataService` class. This instance should be capable of executing the necessary data-related operations that the `ValidationService` will utilize for its validation processes.\n\n**Returns:**  \nNone: The class does not return a value upon initialization.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**  \n- The `__init__` method of the `ValidationService` class accepts a `DataService` instance as a parameter, establishing a dependency that allows the `ValidationService` to perform data validations.\n- This method does not execute any validation or processing; instead, it prepares the `ValidationService` for use by storing the provided `DataService` instance as an attribute for future access.\n- The `ValidationService` includes methods such as `validate_regression_inputs` and `validate_correlation_inputs`, which are responsible for validating input data for regression and correlation analyses, respectively.\n- Each of these validation methods interacts with the `DataService` to check for the existence of specified columns in the database and to ensure that these columns contain numeric data types.\n- If any validation checks fail, the methods raise a `DataError`, providing descriptive messages that indicate the nature of the validation failure. This ensures that only valid data is processed, thereby enhancing the reliability of subsequent analyses.\n```",
