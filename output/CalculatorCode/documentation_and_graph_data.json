This function is commonly used for creating formatted output or for constructing paths and URLs by joining multiple string components.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `separator` (`str`): The string that will be placed between each element of the sequence. This can be any string, including an empty string.\n- `iterable` (`iterable`): A sequence (such as a list, tuple, or set) containing the strings to be joined. All elements in this iterable must be of type `str`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `separator` should be a valid string. It can be empty, which means no characters will be inserted between the joined elements.\n- The `iterable` must contain only strings. If any element in the iterable is not a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.\n\n**Returns:**\n`str`: A single string that consists of the elements of the iterable concatenated together, separated by the specified `separator`.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the input types to ensure that the `iterable` contains only strings.\n- It then iterates through the elements of the `iterable`, appending each element to a result string, inserting the `separator` between elements.\n- If the `iterable` is empty, the function returns an empty string.\n- The function efficiently handles the concatenation process, ensuring optimal performance even with larger datasets. It does not rely on any external modules or complex algorithms, instead utilizing basic string operations to achieve its functionality.",

This facilitates modular design by enabling developers to organize routes into separate routers, which can then be included in the main application with optional prefixes, tags, and other configurations.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `router` (`Router`): An instance of the FastAPI `Router` class that contains the routes to be included in the main application.\n- `prefix` (`Optional[str]`): A string that will be prefixed to all routes in the included router. This allows for namespacing of routes.\n- `tags` (`Optional[List[str]]`): A list of tags that can be associated with the routes in the included router for documentation purposes.\n- `dependencies` (`Optional[List[Depends]]`): A list of dependencies that will be applied to all routes in the included router. This is useful for shared authentication or other middleware.\n- `responses` (`Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]]`): A dictionary that defines custom responses for specific status codes that can be used across the included routes.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `router` must be a valid instance of the FastAPI `Router` class.\n- `prefix` should be a string that represents a valid URL path prefix or `None` if no prefix is needed.\n- `tags` should be a list of strings, each representing a tag for documentation, or `None`.\n- `dependencies` should be a list of FastAPI `Depends` instances or `None`.\n- `responses` should be a dictionary mapping HTTP status codes to response descriptions or `None`.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: This method does not return any value. It modifies the main router by adding the routes from the included router.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by validating the provided `router` to ensure it is an instance of the `Router` class.\n- If a `prefix` is provided, it prepends this prefix to all routes defined in the included router, effectively namespacing them under the specified path.\n- The `tags` parameter allows for the categorization of the routes in the API documentation, making it easier for users to navigate.\n- Any dependencies specified are applied to all routes in the included router, allowing for shared logic such as authentication or request validation.\n- The `responses` parameter enables the definition of custom responses for specific status codes, enhancing the API's documentation and usability.\n- Finally, the method integrates the included router into the main application router, allowing all routes to be accessible as part of the overall API.",

This means that if any intermediate-level directories do not exist, they will be created as well. This function is particularly useful for ensuring that a specified directory path is fully established before performing operations that require that path.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `name` (`str`): The path of the directory to be created. This can be a relative or absolute path.\n- `mode` (`int`, optional): The permissions to set for the newly created directories, expressed as an octal integer. The default value is `0o777`, which grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.\n- `exist_ok` (`bool`, optional): A flag that determines the behavior when the target directory already exists. If set to `True`, the function will not raise an error if the directory already exists. If set to `False` (the default), an error will be raised if the directory already exists.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `name` should be a valid string representing the directory path. It can include multiple levels of directories that need to be created.\n- `mode` should be an integer representing the desired permissions for the new directories, typically in octal format.\n- `exist_ok` should be a boolean value indicating whether to ignore the error if the directory already exists.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: This function does not return any value. It either successfully creates the directories or raises an error if the operation fails.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function first checks if the specified path already exists. If `exist_ok` is `False` and the path exists, it raises a `FileExistsError`.\n- If the path does not exist, the function proceeds to create the directory and any necessary parent directories. It uses the specified `mode` to set the permissions for the newly created directories.\n- The function handles various edge cases, such as invalid paths or permission issues, and raises appropriate exceptions when necessary.\n- This function interacts with the operating system's file system to create directories, ensuring that the specified path is fully established for subsequent file operations.",

These are the items to be printed.\n- `sep` (`str`, optional): A string that is inserted between the objects to be printed. The default is a single space.\n- `end` (`str`, optional): A string that is appended after the last object is printed. The default is a newline character.\n- `file` (`TextIO`, optional): An object with a `write(string)` method; the output will be directed to this object instead of the standard output. The default is `sys.stdout`.\n- `flush` (`bool`, optional): A boolean value that determines whether the output is flushed (i.e., forcibly written out) after the print operation. The default is `False`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `objects` parameter can accept any number of arguments of any type.

If `None`, the result is returned as a string.\n- `sep` (`str`, default `','`): The string used to separate values. The default is a comma, but it can be changed to other delimiters like tabs or semicolons.\n- `na_rep` (`str`, default `''`): The string representation of missing values. This allows users to specify how NaN values should appear in the output file.\n- `float_format` (`str`, default `None`): A format string for floating-point numbers. This can be used to control the precision of floating-point values in the output.\n- `header` (`bool` or `list of str`, default `True`): Whether to write column names. If set to `False`, no header row will be written. If a list of strings is provided, it will be used as the header.\n- `index` (`bool`, default `True`): Whether to write row names (index). If set to `False`, the index will not be included in the output.\n- `mode` (`str`, default `'w'`): The file mode to use when writing. The default is 'write', but it can also be set to 'append'.\n- `encoding` (`str`, default `None`): The character encoding to use for the output file. Common encodings include 'utf-8' and 'utf-16'.\n- `compression` (`str` or `dict`, default `None`): A string indicating the compression mode (e.g., 'gzip', 'zip'). If a dictionary is provided, it can specify additional compression options.\n- `quotechar` (`str`, default `'\"'`): The character used to quote fields containing special characters, such as the delimiter or newline.\n- `quoting` (`int`, default `0`): Controls when quotes should be generated. This can be set to various constants from the `csv` module.\n- `line_terminator` (`str`, default `None`): The character sequence to break lines. If not specified, the default line terminator for the platform will be used.\n- `chunksize` (`int`, default `None`): If specified, the output will be written in chunks of this size, which can be useful for large DataFrames.\n- `date_format` (`str`, default `None`): A format string for datetime objects. This allows users to control how dates are formatted in the output.\n- `doublequote` (`bool`, default `True`): Controls whether to double quote fields that contain the quote character.\n- `escapechar` (`str`, default `None`): The character used to escape the delimiter if quoting is set to `QUOTE_NONE`.\n- `decimal` (`str`, default `'.'`): The character recognized as the decimal point. This can be changed for locales that use commas as decimal points.\n\n**Expected Input:**\nThe function expects a DataFrame object on which it is called.

If the database does not exist, it will be created. This function is essential for executing SQL commands and managing transactions within the SQLite database.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `database` (`str`): The name of the database file to connect to. If the file does not exist, a new database file will be created.\n- `timeout` (`float`, optional): The number of seconds to wait for the database to become available if it is locked. Defaults to 5.0 seconds.\n- `detect_types` (`int`, optional): A flag to enable type detection for the database. Defaults to 0, which means no type detection.\n- `isolation_level` (`Optional[str]`, optional): The isolation level for the connection. If set to `None`, it will use the default isolation level.\n- `check_same_thread` (`bool`, optional): If set to `True`, the connection can only be used in the same thread that created it. Defaults to `True`.\n- `factory` (`Optional[Type[Connection]]`, optional): A custom connection class to use instead of the default.\n- `cached_statements` (`int`, optional): The number of statements to cache for reuse.

This is typically the class that is currently being defined.\n- `obj` (`object`, optional): An instance of the class. If provided, it allows access to the instance's methods and properties.\n- `*args` (`tuple`, optional): Additional positional arguments that can be passed to the method being called from the superclass.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `type` parameter should be a class type that is a subclass of another class.\n- The `obj` parameter, if provided, should be an instance of the `type` class or its subclasses.\n- The `*args` parameter can be any number of additional positional arguments that the superclass method may require.\n\n**Returns:**\n`super` returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of the type specified.

It provides a flexible interface for importing data from various sources, allowing users to specify delimiters, headers, and other parsing options to accommodate different CSV formats.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `filepath_or_buffer` (`Union[str, Path, IO]`): The path to the CSV file or a file-like object. This parameter can accept a string representing the file path, a `Path` object, or an open file object.\n- `sep` (`str`, default `','`): The delimiter to use for separating values in the CSV file. The default is a comma, but it can be set to other characters (e.g., tab, semicolon) as needed.\n- `header` (`Union[int, List[int], None]`, default `'infer'`): Specifies the row(s) to use as the column names. If set to `None`, no header is assumed, and the resulting DataFrame will have default integer column names.\n- `names` (`Union[List[str], None]`, default `None`): A list of column names to use if no header is present in the CSV file. This is useful for providing custom names to the DataFrame columns.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `filepath_or_buffer` must point to a valid CSV file or be a valid file-like object that can be read. \n- The `sep` parameter should be a single character string that is used as the delimiter in the CSV file.\n- The `header` parameter can be an integer or a list of integers indicating the row(s) to be used as headers, or `None` if no header is present.\n- The `names` parameter should be a list of strings that represent the desired column names if the CSV does not contain headers.\n\n**Returns:**\n`DataFrame`: A Pandas DataFrame containing the data read from the CSV file. Each row in the CSV corresponds to a row in the DataFrame, and each column corresponds to a column in the DataFrame.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the `filepath_or_buffer` to ensure it points to a readable source.\n- It then reads the CSV file, parsing the data according to the specified `sep` and `header` parameters.\n- If `header` is set to `'infer'`, the function automatically detects the header row based on the content of the CSV.\n- The function handles various edge cases, such as missing values, different encodings, and malformed rows, ensuring robust data import.\n- Finally, the parsed data is organized into a DataFrame, which is returned to the user for further manipulation and analysis.

This function is typically used in statistical analysis and probability theory to understand the distribution of data.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `x` (`float`): The value at which the CDF is evaluated. This represents the threshold for which the cumulative probability is calculated.\n- `distribution` (`str`): A string indicating the type of probability distribution to use (e.g., \"normal\", \"binomial\", etc.). This parameter determines the mathematical model used to compute the CDF.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `x` should be a numeric value (float) that represents the point of interest in the distribution.\n- `distribution` should be a valid string that corresponds to a recognized probability distribution. The function may have specific requirements for the format or values accepted for different distributions.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The cumulative probability associated with the input value `x` for the specified distribution. This value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the probability of the random variable being less than or equal to `x` is zero, and 1 indicates certainty.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function first validates the input parameters to ensure that `x` is a numeric value and `distribution` is a recognized type.\n- Depending on the specified distribution, the function applies the appropriate mathematical formula or algorithm to compute the CDF.

This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the exception handling hierarchy.\n- The method then assigns the provided `message` and `status_code` to the instance variables, allowing them to be accessed later when the exception is raised or logged.\n- This setup allows the `APIException` to carry both a human-readable message and a machine-readable status code, facilitating better error management in API responses.",

This method sets up the error message and any additional context needed for debugging.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `self`: (`CalculationError`): The instance of the class being created.\n- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that explains the nature of the calculation error. This message is intended to provide clarity on what went wrong during the calculation process.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `message` parameter should be a string that succinctly describes the error encountered. It is expected that this string will provide enough context for developers or users to understand the issue without needing to delve into the code.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: This method does not return a value. Instead, it initializes the instance of the `CalculationError` class with the provided message.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by calling the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class (likely a built-in exception class) is executed, allowing the `CalculationError` to inherit standard exception behavior.\n- The `message` parameter is then passed to the superclass's `__init__` method, which sets the error message for the exception. This message can later be retrieved when the exception is raised, providing insight into the specific calculation error that occurred.\n- The method does not perform any additional logic or computations; its primary role is to facilitate the creation of a well-defined exception with a meaningful message.",

It utilizes the `data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` function to execute a SQL query and retrieve the data. If the `columns` parameter is not specified (i.e., it is `None`), the method will load all available columns from the database.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `columns` (`Optional[List[str]]`): A list of column names to be retrieved from the database. If set to `None`, all columns will be loaded.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `columns` can either be a list of strings representing the specific column names to be fetched or `None` to indicate that all columns should be retrieved. If a list is provided, it should contain valid column names that exist in the database schema.\n\n**Returns:**\n`pandas.DataFrame`: A DataFrame containing the data retrieved from the SQLite database. The DataFrame will have columns corresponding to the specified fields in the query or all fields if no specific columns are requested.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by determining the SQL query to execute based on the provided `columns` parameter. If `columns` is `None`, it constructs a query to select all columns from the relevant database table.\n- It then calls the `data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite` function, passing the database path and the constructed SQL query as arguments.\n- The function retrieves the data from the SQLite database and returns it as a Pandas DataFrame.\n- The method ensures that the data is loaded efficiently and is ready for further analysis or processing using Pandas' capabilities.",

The list can contain any combination of integers and floats. It must not be empty, as the standard deviation cannot be computed for an empty dataset.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The standard deviation of the input list. This value represents the extent to which the numbers in the list deviate from their mean. If the input list is empty, the behavior is undefined, and an error may be raised.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function first ensures that the input `numbers` can be processed as an array-like structure, which is necessary for the subsequent calculation.\n- It then calls the NumPy function `np.std` to compute the standard deviation.

It utilizes the net present value formula to determine the payment amount based on the loan's principal, the annual interest rate, and the total number of payments.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `principal` (`float`): The total amount of the loan that needs to be repaid.\n- `annual_rate` (`float`): The annual interest rate expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).\n- `num_payments` (`int`): The total number of payments to be made over the life of the loan.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `principal` must be a positive float, representing the loan amount.\n- `annual_rate` should be a non-negative float, where 0.0 indicates no interest.\n- `num_payments` must be a positive integer, representing the number of payment periods.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The fixed payment amount that must be paid in each period to fully amortize the loan.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method first checks if the `annual_rate` is zero. If it is, the function calculates the payment by dividing the `principal` evenly across all `num_payments`.\n- If the `annual_rate` is non-zero, it calculates the periodic interest rate by dividing the annual rate by 12 (to convert it to a monthly rate).\n- The method then applies the standard amortization formula, which involves using the `npf.pmt` function from the external library to compute the payment amount based on the principal, periodic interest rate, and total number of payments.\n- The result is the fixed payment amount that will be paid in each period, ensuring that the loan is fully paid off by the end of the specified payment term.",

The Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset. This method is useful for standardizing data, allowing for comparison across different datasets or distributions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the Z-scores will be calculated.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numerical data. The list can include any number of elements, but it should not be empty, as Z-scores cannot be calculated without a mean and standard deviation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`list`: A list of Z-scores corresponding to the input numbers. Each Z-score indicates how many standard deviations the respective number is from the mean of the input list.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array using `np.array`, which allows for efficient numerical operations.\n- It then calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean`, which provides the average value of the dataset.\n- Next, the standard deviation is computed using `np.std`, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.\n- The Z-scores are calculated by subtracting the mean from each number and then dividing the result by the standard deviation. This transformation standardizes the data, allowing for comparison across different scales.\n- Finally, the method returns a list of the calculated Z-scores, providing insight into the relative position of each number within the dataset.",

The confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., mean) with a specified level of confidence. This method utilizes statistical calculations to determine the mean and standard error of the data, and then applies the t-distribution to derive the interval bounds.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values (floats) for which the confidence interval is to be calculated.\n- `confidence_level` (`float`): A decimal value representing the desired confidence level (e.g., 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `data` must be a list containing numerical values (either integers or floats). The list should not be empty, as a confidence interval cannot be calculated without data.\n- `confidence_level` should be a float between 0 and 1, representing the proportion of the population that is expected to fall within the confidence interval. Values outside this range will lead to invalid calculations.\n\n**Returns:**\n`Tuple[float, float]`: A tuple containing two float values that represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval, respectively.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by validating the input data to ensure it is a non-empty list of numerical values.\n- It calculates the mean of the data using the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library, which computes the average of the elements.\n- The standard error of the mean (SEM) is calculated using the formula: SEM = standard deviation / sqrt(n), where `n` is the number of data points. The standard deviation is computed using the `st.sem` function from the statistics library.\n- The t-distribution is then used to determine the critical value based on the specified confidence level and the degrees of freedom (n-1). This is done using the `st.t.ppf` function from the statistics library.\n- Finally, the method computes the confidence interval bounds by adding and subtracting the product of the critical value and the SEM from the mean, resulting in the lower and upper limits of the interval.\n- The method returns the calculated bounds as a tuple.",

It first validates the input parameters to ensure that the specified columns exist and are numeric. Upon successful validation, it retrieves the relevant data from the database and calculates the correlation matrix, returning it in a structured dictionary format.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `db_path` (`str`): The file path to the SQLite database from which data will be retrieved.\n- `table_name` (`str`): The name of the table within the database that contains the data for correlation analysis.\n- `columns` (`List[str]`): A list of column names for which the correlation matrix will be calculated.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `db_path` should be a valid string representing the path to an existing SQLite database file.\n- `table_name` should be a valid string representing the name of a table within the database.\n- `columns` should be a list of strings, each representing a column name. If this list is empty, the function will default to using all numeric columns in the specified table.\n\n**Returns:**\n`Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]`: A nested dictionary representing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the specified columns. The outer dictionary's keys are the column names, and the values are dictionaries where each key is another column name and the value is the correlation coefficient.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the input parameters using the `validate_correlation_inputs` method from the `ValidationService`. This ensures that the specified columns exist in the table and are numeric.\n- If validation fails, a `DataError` is raised, providing feedback on the nature of the validation issue.\n- Upon successful validation, the function calls the `calculate_correlation_matrix` method from the `StatsService`, passing the database path, table name, and validated column names.\n- The `calculate_correlation_matrix` method loads the relevant data from the database, computes the Pearson correlation matrix using the Pandas library, and returns the result as a dictionary.\n- The final output is a structured representation of the correlation coefficients, which can be used for further analysis or reporting.",

This service is particularly useful for validating data integrity across multiple services and models.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is responsible for loading data from various sources into Pandas DataFrames. This service is utilized by `ValidationService` to access and validate data against the existing records.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `ValidationService` expects an instance of `DataService` to be provided during initialization. This instance should be properly configured to connect to the relevant data sources (e.g., SQLite database or CSV files) from which data will be validated.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; instead, it provides methods for performing validations.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- Upon initialization, the `ValidationService` class accepts a `DataService` instance, which it stores for later use.\n- The class includes methods that perform various types of validations, leveraging the functionality of the `DataService` to retrieve data as needed.\n- For each validation method, the service may query the data source to check for conditions such as the existence of records, the uniqueness of values, or the consistency of relationships between different data entities.\n- The validation logic typically involves using Pandas DataFrames to manipulate and analyze the data retrieved from the `DataService`, allowing for efficient and powerful data validation operations.\n- If any validation checks fail, appropriate exceptions (such as `DataError`) may be raised to signal issues with the data integrity, ensuring that the application can handle these errors gracefully.",

It connects to a database to ensure that the specified columns exist and are of a numeric type. This method serves as a critical validation step, ensuring that the data integrity is maintained before proceeding with regression analysis.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `payload` (`RegressionInput`): A Pydantic model that encapsulates the request data for regression analysis. This model includes the necessary attributes that need to be validated against the database.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `payload` parameter must be an instance of the `RegressionInput` model, which should contain attributes that specify the columns to be validated. The columns referenced in the payload must exist in the database and should be numeric in nature. If the payload does not conform to these requirements, a validation error will be raised.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: The method does not return a value. Instead, it performs validation checks and raises an exception if any of the checks fail.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by retrieving the relevant data from the database using the `DataService` to fetch a DataFrame that contains the columns specified in the `payload`.\n- It then iterates through each column specified in the `payload` to check for its existence in the DataFrame.\n- For each column, it verifies that the column is numeric using the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function. This ensures that the data type of the column is appropriate for regression analysis.\n- Additionally, the method checks for any null values in the specified columns using the `isnull()` method, which could indicate incomplete data.\n- If any of these validation checks fail (i.e., a column does not exist, is not numeric, or contains null values), the method raises a `DataError`, providing feedback on the specific validation issue encountered.\n- This method effectively ensures that only valid and complete data is used for regression analysis, thereby enhancing the reliability of the results.",

This is crucial in financial calculations where outflows (expenses) must be represented as negative values to ensure accurate computations of future value.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `field_name` (`str`): The name of the field being validated, which should represent the cash outflow.\n- `value` (`Any`): The value of the cash outflow that needs to be validated.\n- `validation_rules` (`dict`): A dictionary containing the validation rules that the value must satisfy, specifically ensuring that the cash outflow is negative.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `field_name` should be a string that identifies the cash outflow field.\n- `value` can be of any type but is expected to be a numeric type (e.g., `int` or `float`) that represents the cash outflow amount.\n- `validation_rules` should include a rule that checks if the value is negative.\n\n**Returns:**\n`bool`: Returns `True` if the cash outflow value is negative, indicating that it meets the validation criteria; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method utilizes the `field_validator` function to perform the validation. It checks if the `value` provided for the cash outflow is negative.\n- If the value is not negative, the method will return `False`, indicating that the validation has failed.\n- This method is essential for maintaining data integrity in financial calculations, as it ensures that cash outflows are correctly represented in the system.\n- If the validation passes, the method returns `True`, allowing further processing of the cash outflow value in financial computations.",

This is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the regression model, as including the dependent variable in the independent set would lead to incorrect results.\n\n**Parameters:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The method operates on the attributes of the `RegressionInput` class, which should include a list of independent variables and a single dependent variable. The independent variables must be defined prior to invoking this method.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone: The method does not return a value. Instead, it raises a `ValueError` if the dependent variable is found within the list of independent variables.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by checking if the dependent variable is present in the list of independent variables.\n- If the dependent variable is found in the independent variables, a `ValueError` is raised to indicate that the dependent variable cannot be included in the independent set.\n- This validation is essential to maintain the correctness of the regression analysis and prevent logical errors in model fitting.

    "documentation": "### RegressionInput\n\n**Description:**\n`RegressionInput` is a model class designed for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis. It ensures that the input variables used in the regression are distinct, thereby maintaining the integrity of the regression model. This class extends the functionality of the `BaseModel`, inheriting its foundational properties and methods while adding specific validation and management for regression inputs.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- **None**: The `RegressionInput` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The class is expected to be instantiated with input data that includes distinct variables for regression analysis. The specifics of these variables are not detailed in the provided context, but they should adhere to the requirements of OLS regression, such as being numeric and free from multicollinearity.\n\n**Returns:**\n- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation; it creates an object that encapsulates the regression input data.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- Upon instantiation, `RegressionInput` leverages the functionality of `BaseModel` to ensure that the input variables are distinct. This is crucial for OLS regression, where multicollinearity can lead to unreliable estimates.\n- The class may include methods for validating the distinctness of the input variables, potentially utilizing the `field_validator` function to enforce any necessary validation rules.\n- By extending `BaseModel`, `RegressionInput` inherits any shared methods or properties, allowing it to maintain a consistent interface with other models in the application while focusing specifically on the requirements of regression analysis.\n- The class does not have any internal dependencies, making it a self-contained component that can be utilized in various contexts within the broader codebase.",
