This allows for shared logic, such as authentication or validation, across multiple routes.\n- `responses` (`Optional[Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]]`): An optional dictionary that defines custom responses for the included routes, allowing for more detailed API documentation.\n- `default_response_class` (`Optional[Type[Response]]`): An optional class that defines the default response type for the included routes.\n- `include_in_schema` (`bool`): A boolean flag indicating whether the routes from the included router should be included in the OpenAPI schema. Defaults to `True`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `router` parameter must be an instance of the `Router` class.\n- The `prefix` should be a string if provided, and it should not contain any invalid characters for URL paths.\n- The `tags` should be a list of strings, each representing a tag for documentation.\n- The `dependencies` should be a list of dependency instances, if provided.\n- The `responses` should be a dictionary mapping HTTP status codes to response descriptions.\n- The `default_response_class` should be a valid response class if provided.\n- The `include_in_schema` should be a boolean value.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: This function does not return any value. It modifies the current router by adding the routes from the included router.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the provided `router` to ensure it is an instance of the `Router` class.\n- If a `prefix` is provided, it is prepended to all routes in the included router, effectively namespacing them.\n- The function then iterates over the routes in the included router, applying any specified `dependencies`, `responses`, and `default_response_class` to each route.\n- If `tags` are provided, they are associated with the routes for documentation purposes.\n- Finally, the function updates the current router's internal structure to include the routes from the included router, ensuring that they are accessible through the API. The `include_in_schema` parameter determines whether these routes should appear in the generated OpenAPI schema, allowing for better API documentation.",

This means that if any intermediate-level directories do not exist, they will be created as well. It is particularly useful for ensuring that a specified directory path is fully created without needing to check each level of the directory hierarchy manually.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `name` (`str`): The path of the directory to be created. This can be a relative or absolute path.\n- `mode` (`int`, optional): The permissions to set for the newly created directories, expressed as an octal integer. The default is `0o777`, which gives read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.\n- `exist_ok` (`bool`, optional): A flag that, when set to `True`, allows the function to succeed even if the target directory already exists. If `False` (the default), an error will be raised if the directory already exists.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `name` should be a valid string representing the directory path.

This function facilitates data persistence and sharing by converting the structured data in the DataFrame into a widely-used text format that can be easily read and processed by various applications.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `path_or_buf` (`str` or `None`): The file path or object to write the CSV data to. If `None`, the result is returned as a string.\n- `sep` (`str`, default `','`): The string used to separate values. The default is a comma, but it can be changed to other delimiters like tabs or semicolons.\n- `na_rep` (`str`, default `''`): The string representation of missing values. This allows users to specify how NaN values should be represented in the output file.\n- `float_format` (`str`, default `None`): A format string for floating-point numbers. This can be used to control the precision of the output.\n- `header` (`bool` or `list of str`, default `True`): Whether to write column names. If a list is provided, it specifies the names to use.\n- `index` (`bool`, default `True`): Whether to write row indices. If set to `False`, the index will not be included in the output.\n- `mode` (`str`, default `'w'`): The file mode to open the file. Common values are `'w'` for write and `'a'` for append.\n- `encoding` (`str`, default `None`): The encoding to use for the output file. Common encodings include 'utf-8' and 'utf-16'.\n- `compression` (`str` or `dict`, default `None`): The compression mode to use for the output file. Options include 'infer', 'gzip', 'bz2', 'zip', and 'xz'.\n- `quotechar` (`str`, default `'\"'`): The character used to quote fields containing special characters, such as the separator or newline.\n- `quoting` (`int`, default `0`): Controls when quotes should be generated. It can take values from the `csv` module's constants.\n- `line_terminator` (`str`, default `None`): The character sequence to break lines. If not specified, the default line terminator is used.\n- `chunksize` (`int`, default `None`): If specified, it writes the DataFrame in chunks of the specified size.\n- `date_format` (`str`, default `None`): A format string for datetime objects.\n- `doublequote` (`bool`, default `True`): Controls whether to double quote fields containing the quote character.\n- `escapechar` (`str`, default `None`): The character used to escape the `quotechar` if quoting is enabled.\n- `decimal` (`str`, default `'.'`): The character recognized as decimal point (e.g., use ',' for European data).\n- `errors` (`str`, default `'strict'`): How to handle encoding errors.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `path_or_buf` parameter should be a valid file path or a writable object. Other parameters should be provided as needed based on the desired output format and structure.\n- The DataFrame must contain data that can be represented in a tabular format, with appropriate handling for missing values and data types.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None` or `str`: If `path_or_buf` is specified, the function writes the DataFrame to the specified file and returns `None`.

This function allows users to easily transfer data from a pandas DataFrame to a specified SQL database table, facilitating data persistence and manipulation within a relational database management system.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `name` (`str`): The name of the SQL table to which the DataFrame will be written.\n- `con`: A SQLAlchemy engine or a SQLite3 database connection object. This parameter specifies the database connection to which the DataFrame will be written.\n- `if_exists` (`str`, optional): Determines the behavior if the table already exists. Options include:\n  - `'fail'`: Raise a ValueError.\n  - `'replace'`: Drop the table before inserting new values.\n  - `'append'`: Insert new values to the existing table.\n  Default is `'fail'`.\n- `index` (`bool`, optional): Whether to write the DataFrame index as a column. Default is `True`.\n- `index_label` (optional): Column label for the index column(s). If None, the index name is used. If the DataFrame has a MultiIndex, this should be a sequence of strings.\n- `chunksize` (`int`, optional): Number of rows to be written at a time. This can help manage memory usage when writing large DataFrames.\n- `dtype` (optional): A dictionary specifying the SQL data types for columns. This allows for customization of how DataFrame columns are represented in the SQL table.\n- `method` (optional): Controls the insertion method.

This function checks the integrity and compatibility of the input data, which is crucial for accurate statistical analysis and interpretation of correlation results.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data1` (`list` or `array-like`): The first dataset to be analyzed for correlation. This should be a one-dimensional collection of numerical values.\n- `data2` (`list` or `array-like`): The second dataset to be analyzed for correlation. This should also be a one-dimensional collection of numerical values.\n- `method` (`str`, optional): The method of correlation to be used, such as 'pearson', 'kendall', or 'spearman'. Defaults to 'pearson'. This parameter determines the statistical technique applied during the correlation calculation.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `data1` and `data2` must be of the same length and contain numerical values. They should not be empty.\n- The `method` parameter should be a string that matches one of the accepted correlation methods. If an unsupported method is provided, the function should raise an error.\n\n**Returns:**\n`bool`: Returns `True` if the inputs are valid for correlation analysis; otherwise, it raises an exception indicating the nature of the validation failure.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by checking if both `data1` and `data2` are non-empty and of equal length. If either condition fails, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- It then verifies that all elements in both datasets are numeric. If any non-numeric values are found, it raises a `TypeError`.\n- If the `method` parameter is provided, the function checks if it matches one of the predefined correlation methods. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- Finally, if all checks pass, the function returns `True`, indicating that the inputs are valid for correlation analysis. This validation process ensures that subsequent correlation calculations can be performed without errors.",

It is primarily used in class inheritance to call methods from a parent class without explicitly naming it, which helps in maintaining the code's flexibility and readability.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- None\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `super` function is typically called within a method of a class that inherits from another class. It does not require any parameters when called in this context, but it can take two optional arguments: the class and the instance. The first argument is the class whose methods are to be accessed, and the second is the instance of the class.\n\n**Returns:**\n- An instance of the superclass, which allows access to its methods. The type of the returned object is determined by the class hierarchy.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- When `super` is called, it looks up the method resolution order (MRO) to find the next class in the hierarchy that has the method being called. This is particularly useful in multiple inheritance scenarios, where it helps to avoid ambiguity about which superclass method should be invoked.\n- The `super` function can be used in two forms:\n  1. `super()` - This form automatically uses the class and instance from which it is called.\n  2. `super(class, instance)` - This form explicitly specifies the class and instance, which can be useful in more complex inheritance structures.\n- By using `super`, developers can ensure that the correct method from the superclass is called, which is essential for maintaining the intended behavior of inherited classes.

It provides a way to convert data into a NumPy array, which is a powerful data structure for numerical computations. The function allows for various configurations regarding data type, memory layout, and dimensionality.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `object` (`Any`): The input data to be converted into an array. This can be a list, tuple, or any object that can be converted to an array.\n- `dtype` (`Optional[type]`): The desired data type for the array. If not specified, NumPy will infer the data type from the input object.\n- `copy` (`bool`): If set to `True`, a new array is always created. If `False`, a view of the original data may be returned if possible.\n- `order` (`Optional[str]`): Specifies the desired memory layout order for the array. Options include 'C' (row-major) or 'F' (column-major).\n- `subok` (`bool`): If `True`, subclasses of `ndarray` will be passed through, otherwise, the returned array will be forced to be a base class array.\n- `ndmin` (`int`): Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting array should have. If the input data has fewer dimensions, it will be padded with ones.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `object` parameter can be any array-like structure, including lists, tuples, or other sequences. \n- The `dtype` parameter can be any valid NumPy data type (e.g., `np.int32`, `np.float64`).\n- The `order` parameter should be either 'C' or 'F' if specified.\n- The `ndmin` parameter should be a non-negative integer.\n\n**Returns:**\n`ndarray`: A NumPy array containing the data from the input object, with the specified configurations applied.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by checking the type of the input object to determine how to convert it into an array.\n- If a `dtype` is provided, it will enforce this type on the resulting array.

The CDF is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, representing the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value. This function is typically used in statistical analysis and modeling to understand the behavior of random variables.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `x` (`float`): The value at which the CDF is evaluated. This represents the point on the random variable's distribution for which the cumulative probability is calculated.\n- `distribution` (`str`): A string indicating the type of distribution for which the CDF is to be computed (e.g., \"normal\", \"exponential\", \"binomial\"). This parameter determines the underlying mathematical model used in the calculation.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `x` should be a numeric value (float) that represents the point of interest in the distribution.\n- `distribution` should be a valid string corresponding to one of the supported distributions. The function may have specific requirements or constraints on the types of distributions it can handle, which should be checked in the implementation or additional documentation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The cumulative probability associated with the input value `x` for the specified distribution. The return value is a probability that ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the likelihood that a random variable from the specified distribution is less than or equal to `x`.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure that `x` is a numeric value and that `distribution` is a recognized string.\n- Based on the specified distribution, the function applies the appropriate mathematical formula or algorithm to compute the CDF. This may involve using predefined statistical functions or libraries that implement the CDF for various distributions.\n- The computed CDF value is then returned as the output of the function.\n- Since `cdf` does not have any internal dependencies, it operates independently, relying solely on the provided parameters to perform its calculations.",

Variance is a statistical measure that represents the degree of spread in a set of values. It quantifies how much the values deviate from the mean of the dataset.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `a` (`array_like`): The input array or dataset for which the variance is to be computed. This can be a list, tuple, or any array-like structure.\n- `axis` (`Optional[int]`): The axis or axes along which the variance is computed. If `None`, the variance is computed over the entire array. Default is `None`.\n- `dtype` (`Optional[type]`): The data type to use in the computation. If not specified, the function will use the data type of the input array.\n- `ddof` (`int`): \"Delta Degrees of Freedom.\" The divisor used in the calculation is `N - ddof`, where `N` is the number of elements. Default is `0`, which calculates the population variance. Setting `ddof` to `1` calculates the sample variance.\n- `keepdims` (`bool`): If set to `True`, the reduced axes are retained in the result as dimensions with size one. This is useful for broadcasting. Default is `False`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The input `a` should be an array-like structure containing numerical values (integers or floats).\n- The `axis` parameter can be an integer specifying a single axis or a tuple of integers for multiple axes. If `None`, the variance is calculated for the flattened array.\n- The `dtype` should be a valid data type if specified; otherwise, it defaults to the type of `a`.\n- The `ddof` parameter should be a non-negative integer.\n- The `keepdims` parameter should be a boolean value.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The variance of the input array along the specified axis. If the input is multi-dimensional and `keepdims` is set to `True`, the result will maintain the dimensions of the input array.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the input array `a` to ensure it is array-like and contains numerical values.\n- It then checks the specified `axis` to determine how to compute the variance. If `axis` is `None`, it flattens the array and computes the variance across all elements.\n- The mean of the array is calculated, and the squared differences from the mean are computed.\n- The variance is then calculated by averaging these squared differences, adjusted by the `ddof` parameter to account for either population or sample variance.\n- Finally, if `keepdims` is set to `True`, the function reshapes the output to maintain the original dimensions of the input array, allowing for consistent broadcasting in further calculations.",

The specific handling of the input value will depend on the implementation of the function.\n\n**Returns:**\n`bool`: The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the input value is null or empty. A return value of `True` signifies that the value is null, while `False` indicates that it is not.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function evaluates the input value against predefined criteria for nullity. This typically includes checks for common representations of null or empty values, such as `None`, `null`, empty strings, or other equivalent representations based on the context.\n- The function may utilize conditional statements to assess the input and return the appropriate boolean value.\n- Since `isnull` has no internal dependencies, it operates independently and does not call any other functions or modules. Its logic is straightforward and focused solely on the evaluation of the input value.",

Specifically, it requires at least two columns to be present if the correlation analysis is to be performed. The exact format of the input data (e.g., DataFrame, list of lists) is not specified, but it must be compatible with the correlation matrix computation.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- `CorrelationInput` inherits from `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for the model. The class does not implement its own constructor or methods but relies on the inherited functionality from `BaseModel`.\n- The primary validation logic is likely implemented to check the number of columns in the input data. If the input does not meet the requirement of having at least two columns, an appropriate exception (such as `ValueError`) may be raised to indicate the issue.\n- The class serves as a specialized model for handling correlation input, ensuring that any data passed to it is suitable for correlation analysis, thereby maintaining data integrity and preventing errors in subsequent calculations.",

Options include:\n  - `'two-sided'`: Tests if the means are different (default).\n  - `'less'`: Tests if the mean of `sample1` is less than the mean of `sample2`.\n  - `'greater'`: Tests if the mean of `sample1` is greater than the mean of `sample2`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- Both `sample1` and `sample2` should be numerical data arrays (lists or NumPy arrays) containing observations from two independent samples.\n- The input data should not contain NaN values, as they may lead to invalid test results.\n- The `equal_var` parameter must be a boolean value, and the `alternative` parameter should be one of the specified string options.\n\n**Returns:**\n`Ttest_indResult`: An object containing the t-statistic and the p-value for the test, along with additional information about the test results.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by validating the input data to ensure that both samples are compatible in shape and contain valid numerical values.\n- It calculates the means and standard deviations of both samples.\n- Depending on the value of the `equal_var` parameter, it computes either the standard t-test (assuming equal variances) or Welch\u2019s t-test (for unequal variances):\n  - For the standard t-test, it calculates the pooled standard deviation.\n  - For Welch\u2019s t-test, it computes the standard error using the individual sample variances.\n- The t-statistic is then calculated based on the difference between the sample means, adjusted for the standard error.\n- Finally, the method calculates the p-value using the t-distribution, which indicates the probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis.\n- The results, including the t-statistic and p-value, are returned in a structured format for easy interpretation.",

This ensures that the calling code can handle errors gracefully.",

This method initializes the exception with a message and potentially other attributes inherited from its parent class.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `self`: Represents the instance of the class being created.\n- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the error encountered. This message is passed to the parent class's constructor to ensure that the error context is preserved.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `message` parameter should be a string that describes the nature of the data error. It is expected to provide sufficient context for debugging or logging purposes. There are no specific constraints on the content of the message, but it should be meaningful and informative.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone: The constructor does not return a value; it initializes the instance of the `DataError` class.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by calling the constructor of its parent class using `super().__init__(message)`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed, allowing the `DataError` instance to inherit the properties and behaviors of the base exception class.\n- The `message` parameter is passed to the parent class's constructor, which typically sets the error message that can be retrieved later when the exception is raised or caught.\n- This method does not contain additional logic beyond the initialization process, as its primary role is to set up the exception with the provided message.",

It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid based on the actual data stored in the database. This service is particularly useful for validating inputs for regression and correlation analyses.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is used to interact with the data layer and retrieve data for validation purposes. This parameter is optional and defaults to a predefined `data_service`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `data_svc` parameter should be an instance of the `DataService` class, which provides methods for data retrieval. \n- The class methods `validate_regression_inputs` and `validate_correlation_inputs` expect payloads of type `RegressionInput` and `CorrelationInput`, respectively. These payloads should contain the necessary information for validation, such as database paths, table names, and variable names.\n\n**Returns:**\n- The methods `validate_regression_inputs` and `validate_correlation_inputs` return `True` if the validation is successful.\n- If validation fails, they raise a `DataError` with a descriptive message indicating the nature of the failure.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- Upon initialization, the `ValidationService` class establishes a dependency on the `DataService`, which is essential for fetching data from the database.\n- The `validate_regression_inputs` method performs the following steps:\n  1. It retrieves a DataFrame from the database using the specified database path and table name from the `RegressionInput` payload.\n  2. It checks that all specified variables (dependent and independent) exist in the DataFrame's columns.\n  3. It verifies that each variable is numeric and contains valid (non-null) data.\n  4. If any checks fail, a `DataError` is raised with a specific message.\n  \n- The `validate_correlation_inputs` method follows a similar process:\n  1. It retrieves the DataFrame from the database.\n  2. It checks for the presence of the specified columns for correlation analysis, ensuring at least two numeric columns are available.\n  3. It raises a `DataError` if any columns are missing or if they are not numeric.\n  \n- Both methods print success messages upon successful validation, providing feedback to the user about the validation process.",

Documentation may be incomplete.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- `Exception`\n- `__init__`\n- `super().__init__`\n### APIException\n\n**Description:**\n`APIException` is a custom base exception class designed specifically for handling errors within the API framework of the application. By extending the built-in `Exception` class, it allows for the creation of structured and meaningful error messages that can be returned in a JSON format. This facilitates the implementation of a custom exception handler in the main application logic, enabling consistent error reporting across the API.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\nNone.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `APIException` class does not require any specific input parameters upon instantiation. However, it is common practice to pass a descriptive message string when raising this exception to provide context about the error.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `APIException` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, which serves as the foundation for all exceptions in Python. This inheritance allows `APIException` to leverage the standard exception handling mechanisms provided by Python.\n- When an instance of `APIException` is created, it can optionally accept a message that describes the error. This message can be accessed later when the exception is caught, allowing developers to understand the nature of the error that occurred.\n- The primary purpose of `APIException` is to serve as a base class for other specific exceptions that may arise within the API, enabling a structured approach to error handling and ensuring that all API-related errors can be managed consistently.\n- The class does not introduce any additional attributes or methods beyond what is inherited from the `Exception` class, focusing solely on providing a custom exception type for the API context.",

This method sets up the exception's message and any additional context that may be necessary for debugging or logging purposes.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `self`: Represents the instance of the class being created.\n- `message` (`str`): A string that describes the error or exception. This message provides context about the nature of the exception.\n- `status_code` (`int`, optional): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception. This can be useful for API responses to indicate the type of error that occurred.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `message` parameter should be a descriptive string that conveys the reason for the exception. It is expected to be non-empty.\n- The `status_code` parameter, if provided, should be a valid HTTP status code (e.g., 400 for Bad Request, 404 for Not Found).

It extends the base exception class, allowing for more specific error handling when data-related issues arise.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- **None**: The `DataError` class does not define any additional parameters or attributes beyond those inherited from its parent class.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- This class is intended to be raised as an exception, typically when there is an issue with data integrity or processing. It does not take any specific input parameters upon instantiation, but it can accept a message string that describes the error.\n\n**Returns:**\n- **None**: As an exception class, `DataError` does not return a value. Instead, it serves as a signal that an error has occurred, which can be caught and handled by the calling code.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `DataError` class inherits from the built-in exception class, utilizing the `super().__init__` method to initialize the base class. This allows it to inherit standard exception behavior while providing a specific context for data-related errors.\n- When an instance of `DataError` is raised, it can carry a message that provides additional information about the nature of the error, which can be useful for debugging and logging purposes.\n- The class does not implement any additional methods or properties, relying on the functionality provided by the base exception class to manage error reporting and handling.",

    "documentation": "### ValidationService\n\n**Description:**\n`ValidationService` is a service class dedicated to performing complex, cross-service validations that extend beyond simple model field checks. It connects various models to the data layer, ensuring that incoming requests are not only well-formed but also logically valid against the actual data present in the system. This service plays a crucial role in maintaining data integrity and consistency across the application.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- **data_svc** (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class, which is utilized for loading data from various sources into Pandas DataFrames. This service is essential for the validation processes that require access to actual data.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `ValidationService` expects to interact with valid data structures, particularly Pandas DataFrames, which are populated with data retrieved through the `DataService`. The input data should be structured in a way that allows for effective validation against business rules and logical constraints.\n\n**Returns:**\n- `None`: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides methods that perform validation checks and may raise exceptions if validation fails.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- Upon instantiation, `ValidationService` initializes its attributes, particularly the `data_svc` attribute, which is an instance of `DataService`. This setup allows the validation service to access and manipulate data as needed.\n- The class likely contains multiple methods that implement various validation rules, which may involve querying the data layer through `data_svc` to retrieve relevant datasets for comparison.\n- Validation checks may include ensuring that input data adheres to specific business rules, checking for data integrity, and confirming that relationships between different data entities are logically sound.\n- If any validation checks fail, the service may raise a `DataError` exception, providing feedback on the nature of the validation failure. This error handling mechanism is crucial for maintaining robust data processing workflows.\n- Overall, `ValidationService` acts as a gatekeeper for data integrity, ensuring that only valid data is processed and utilized within the application, thereby preventing potential issues that could arise from invalid or inconsistent data.",
