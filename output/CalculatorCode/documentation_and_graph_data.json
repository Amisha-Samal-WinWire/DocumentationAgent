This class serves as a centralized point for accessing configuration values throughout the application, ensuring that settings can be easily modified and accessed in a consistent manner.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- **None**: The `Settings` class does not take any parameters upon initialization. Instead, it relies on environment variables to populate its attributes.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `Settings` class expects environment variables to be set prior to its instantiation. These variables should correspond to the configuration settings required by the application. The absence of expected environment variables may lead to default values being used or errors being raised, depending on the implementation.\n\n**Returns:**\n- **None**: The `Settings` class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it provides access to various configuration attributes that can be retrieved after the class is initialized.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings`, which is part of an external library designed to facilitate the loading and validation of settings from various sources, including environment variables.\n- Upon initialization, the class automatically reads the relevant environment variables and populates its attributes accordingly.\n- The class may also utilize the `Config` external library to manage configuration settings, providing additional functionality such as validation, type conversion, and default values.\n- The logic within the `Settings` class ensures that any changes to the environment variables are reflected in the application settings, promoting a dynamic configuration management approach.",

The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `APIException` class, allowing for the specification of an error message and an associated HTTP status code. This enables consistent error handling and reporting throughout the API.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `message` (`str`): A descriptive message that provides details about the exception. This message is intended to inform the user or developer about the nature of the error.\n- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the error. This code is used to indicate the type of error that occurred (e.g., 404 for \"Not Found\", 500 for \"Internal Server Error\").\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `message` should be a non-empty string that clearly describes the error encountered.\n- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically an integer in the range of 100 to 599, representing various types of responses as defined by the HTTP specification.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone: The method does not return a value; it initializes the exception instance.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`, which ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the exception handling hierarchy.\n- The method then assigns the provided `message` and `status_code` to the instance variables, allowing them to be accessed later when the exception is raised or logged.\n- This setup allows the `APIException` to carry both a human-readable message and a machine-readable status code, facilitating better error management in API responses.",

This method computes key statistical measures including the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, and returns them in a structured dictionary format.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the descriptive statistics will be calculated.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numeric data. It can include integers and floats, and the list should not be empty. If the list is empty, the function may raise an error or return an incomplete result, depending on the implementation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`dict`: A dictionary containing the following descriptive statistics:\n- `mean`: The average of the numbers.\n- `median`: The middle value when the numbers are sorted.\n- `mode`: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the list.\n- `variance`: A measure of how much the numbers vary from the mean.\n- `standard_deviation`: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance of each number from the mean.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by utilizing the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library to calculate the mean of the input list.\n- It then computes the median using `np.median`, which sorts the list and finds the middle value.\n- The mode is determined using `stats.mode` from the SciPy library, which identifies the most frequently occurring value(s) in the list.\n- Variance is calculated with `np.var`, which measures the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n- Finally, the standard deviation is computed using `np.std`, providing insight into the dispersion of the dataset.\n- All computed statistics are organized into a dictionary and returned, allowing easy access to each statistical measure.",

Documentation may be incomplete.\n### calculate_loan_payment(rate: float, nper: int, pv: float) -> float\n\n**Description:**\nThe `calculate_loan_payment` function computes the periodic payment required to repay a loan based on the specified interest rate, number of payment periods, and present value of the loan. It serves as an endpoint for clients to determine their loan payment obligations.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `rate` (`float`): The interest rate for the loan, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).\n- `nper` (`int`): The total number of payment periods over which the loan will be repaid.\n- `pv` (`float`): The present value or principal amount of the loan.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `rate` should be a non-negative float. A value of 0 indicates a zero-interest loan.\n- `nper` should be a positive integer representing the total number of payments.\n- `pv` should be a positive float representing the loan amount.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The calculated periodic payment amount that the borrower must pay in each period to fully amortize the loan.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the input parameters to ensure they meet the expected criteria (e.g., non-negative rates, positive number of periods, and positive present value).\n- It then utilizes the `calculate_payment` method from the `FinancialService` class, which employs the net present value formula to determine the periodic payment based on the provided inputs.\n- If any errors occur during the calculation (such as invalid input types), the function raises an `APIException` with an appropriate status code and error message, ensuring that clients receive structured feedback on their requests.",

If these conditions are not met, appropriate errors are raised.\n- The data retrieval process involves executing a SQL query to fetch all records from the specified table, which are then loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further statistical analysis.\n- The module may also facilitate the invocation of various statistical methods provided by the `StatsService`, allowing for computations such as mean, standard deviation, and hypothesis testing, leveraging external libraries like NumPy and SciPy as needed. \n\nThis module acts as a crucial link between the data storage layer and the statistical analysis layer, ensuring that data is accurately retrieved and processed for insights.",

Instead, it provides methods that may return validation results or raise exceptions based on the validation logic.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `ValidationService` class utilizes the `DataService` to fetch data from a SQLite database, specifically using the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method to retrieve tables as pandas DataFrames.\n- It performs a series of validation checks on the data retrieved, ensuring that the input meets the necessary criteria for logical consistency and integrity.\n- The class may raise custom exceptions, such as `DataError`, when validation fails or when issues arise during data retrieval, providing clear feedback for debugging and error handling.\n- The validation logic encompasses checks for distinctness of input variables, ensuring that they do not violate statistical assumptions, particularly when preparing data for regression analysis or correlation calculations.\n- Overall, the `ValidationService` acts as a mediator between the data layer and the application logic, ensuring that all data interactions are validated against the actual data context.",
