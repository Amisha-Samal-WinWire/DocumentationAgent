Documentation may be incomplete.\n### create_sample_database() -> None\n\n**Description:**\nThe `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data derived from a CSV file. It first creates a CSV file containing sample data, then establishes a connection to a SQLite database, creates a table, and populates it with the data from the CSV file.\n\n**Parameters:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently by generating its own sample data and creating a database.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by checking if a directory for storing the CSV file exists; if not, it creates the necessary directories using `os.makedirs`.\n- It then generates a sample DataFrame using the `pd.DataFrame` class, which contains predefined housing data.\n- This DataFrame is saved to a CSV file using the `df.to_csv` method.\n- Before creating the SQLite database, the function checks if a previous database file exists. If it does, it removes the old file using `os.remove` to ensure a fresh start.\n- A new SQLite database connection is established using `sqlite3.connect`, and a cursor object is created to execute SQL commands.\n- The function creates a table in the database to hold the housing data.\n- It then loads the data from the CSV file into the SQLite table using the `df.to_sql` method.\n- Finally, the function closes the database connection with `conn.close`, ensuring that all changes are saved and resources are released. Throughout the process, it handles potential errors using `sqlite3.Error` to maintain robustness.",

    "documentation": "### join\n\n**Description:**\nThe `join` function is designed to concatenate a sequence of strings into a single string, with a specified separator placed between each element. This function is commonly used for creating formatted output or for constructing paths and URLs from individual components.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `separator` (`str`): A string that will be inserted between each of the elements being joined. This can be any string, including an empty string.\n- `iterable` (`iterable`): A sequence (such as a list, tuple, or set) containing the strings to be joined. All elements in this iterable must be of type `str`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `separator` should be a string, which can include spaces, punctuation, or other characters. It can also be an empty string if no separator is desired.\n- The `iterable` must contain only string elements. If any element is not a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.\n\n**Returns:**\n`str`: A single string that results from concatenating the elements of the iterable, separated by the specified separator.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the input types of the `separator` and `iterable`. It ensures that the `separator` is a string and that all elements of the `iterable` are also strings.\n- If the `iterable` is empty, the function returns an empty string.\n- The function then iterates through the elements of the `iterable`, appending each element to the result string, preceded by the `separator`.\n- Finally, it returns the constructed string. This function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided parameters.",

It serves as a central point for defining endpoints, handling requests, and routing them to the appropriate handler functions. This class is essential for organizing the API structure and ensuring that incoming requests are processed efficiently.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- **None**: The `APIRouter` class does not require any parameters upon instantiation.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `APIRouter` class is expected to be used within a web application context where it will receive HTTP requests. The specific routes and their corresponding handler functions will be defined by the user of the class.\n\n**Returns:**\n- **None**: The class does not return any value upon instantiation.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `APIRouter` class initializes an internal structure to hold the routes and their associated handler functions.\n- It provides methods for adding new routes, which typically include specifying the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and the path for the route.\n- When a request is received, the router matches the request's method and path against its defined routes to determine the appropriate handler.\n- The class may also include middleware support, allowing for pre-processing of requests before they reach the handler functions.\n- Overall, `APIRouter` streamlines the process of managing API endpoints, making it easier to maintain and scale the web application.",

This means that if any intermediate-level directories do not exist, they will be created as well. The function can also set permissions for the newly created directories and has an option to avoid raising an error if the target directory already exists.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `name` (`str`): The path of the directory to be created. This can be a relative or absolute path.\n- `mode` (`int`, optional): The permissions mode to set for the newly created directories, specified as an octal integer. The default value is `0o777`, which grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.\n- `exist_ok` (`bool`, optional): A flag that indicates whether to raise an error if the target directory already exists. If set to `True`, the function will not raise an error if the directory already exists; if set to `False` (the default), it will raise a `FileExistsError`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `name` should be a string representing the desired directory path.

It facilitates the transfer of data from a pandas DataFrame into a specified SQL table, enabling seamless integration of data analysis and database management.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `name` (`str`): The name of the SQL table to which the DataFrame will be written.\n- `con`: A SQLAlchemy engine or a SQLite3 database connection object that specifies the database to connect to.\n- `if_exists` (`str`, optional): Determines the behavior if the table already exists. Options include:\n  - `'fail'`: Raise a ValueError.\n  - `'replace'`: Drop the table before inserting new values.\n  - `'append'`: Insert new values to the existing table.\n- `index` (`bool`, optional): Whether to write the DataFrame index as a column. Default is `True`.\n- `index_label` (`Union[str, List[str]]`, optional): Column label(s) for the index column(s). If None, the index will be written with the default name.\n- `chunksize` (`int`, optional): Number of rows to be written at a time. Useful for large DataFrames to avoid memory issues.\n- `dtype` (`dict`, optional): A dictionary specifying the SQL data types for columns. This allows for customization of how data types are interpreted in the SQL table.\n- `method` (`str`, optional): The method used for inserting data. Options include:\n  - `'multi'`: Insert multiple rows in a single INSERT statement.\n  - A callable that takes a connection and a DataFrame chunk.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `name` parameter should be a valid string representing the desired SQL table name.\n- The `con` parameter must be a valid SQLAlchemy engine or SQLite connection object.\n- The `if_exists` parameter should be one of the specified string options.\n- The `index` parameter should be a boolean value.\n- The `index_label` can be a string or a list of strings, or None.\n- The `chunksize` should be a positive integer or None.\n- The `dtype` should be a dictionary mapping column names to SQL data types or None.\n- The `method` should be a string or a callable, depending on the desired insertion method.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: The method does not return any value. It performs the operation of writing the DataFrame to the specified SQL table.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by establishing a connection to the specified database using the provided connection object.\n- It checks the `if_exists` parameter to determine how to handle the situation if the table already exists in the database.\n- If `index` is set to `True`, the DataFrame's index is included in the SQL table, with the option to specify its label through `index_label`.\n- The method may utilize the `chunksize` parameter to write the DataFrame in smaller batches, which is particularly useful for large datasets to optimize memory usage and performance.\n- The `dtype` parameter allows for explicit control over the SQL data types assigned to each column, ensuring that data is stored in the desired format.\n- Depending on the `method` parameter, the method may use different strategies for inserting data, such as executing multiple insert statements in one go or using a custom insertion function.\n- Finally, the method executes the necessary SQL commands to insert the DataFrame data into the specified table, completing the operation without returning any value.",

Each key represents a rule type (e.g., \"required\", \"type\", \"length\") and the corresponding value provides the necessary parameters for that rule.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `field_name` should be a string representing the name of the field (e.g., \"username\", \"email\").\n- `value` can be of any type, as it represents the actual data being validated.\n- `validation_rules` should be a dictionary with specific keys for validation criteria. For example, it may include:\n  - `\"required\"`: A boolean indicating if the field must be present.\n  - `\"type\"`: A string specifying the expected data type (e.g., \"string\", \"integer\").\n  - `\"length\"`: A tuple indicating the minimum and maximum length for string values.\n\n**Returns:**\n`bool`: Returns `True` if the value passes all validation rules; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by checking if the field is marked as required. If so, it verifies that the value is not empty or null.\n- Next, it checks the type of the value against the specified type in the validation rules. If the type does not match, the function returns `False`.\n- If length constraints are provided, the function checks that the length of the value falls within the specified range.\n- The function may also include additional validation rules as defined in the `validation_rules` dictionary, applying each rule sequentially.\n- If all checks pass, the function concludes by returning `True`, indicating that the value is valid according to the specified criteria. \n\nThis function does not have any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility for field validation.",

It provides a flexible way to load data from various sources, including local files and URLs, and offers numerous options for parsing the data, handling missing values, and specifying data types.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `filepath_or_buffer` (`Union[str, Path, IO]`): The file path or object to read. This can be a string representing the file path, a `Path` object, or any object with a `read()` method (like a file-like object).\n- `sep` (`str`, default `','`): The delimiter to use for separating values. The default is a comma, but it can be set to other characters (e.g., tab, semicolon).\n- `header` (`Union[int, List[int], None]`, default `'infer'`): Row(s) to use as the column names. If set to `None`, no header row is assumed, and default integer column names are assigned.\n- `names` (`Union[List[str], None]`, default `None`): A list of column names to use if no header is present. This is useful when the CSV file does not contain header information.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `filepath_or_buffer` parameter should point to a valid CSV file or a file-like object. The file must be accessible and readable.\n- The `sep` parameter should be a single character string that correctly represents the delimiter used in the CSV file.\n- The `header` and `names` parameters should be used appropriately based on the structure of the CSV file. If `header` is set to `None`, `names` must be provided if column names are required.\n\n**Returns:**\n`DataFrame`: A Pandas DataFrame containing the data read from the CSV file. Each row in the CSV corresponds to a row in the DataFrame, and each column is represented as a DataFrame column.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by validating the `filepath_or_buffer` to ensure it points to a readable source.\n- It then reads the data from the specified source, using the provided delimiter to parse the values.\n- If the `header` parameter is set to `'infer'`, the function automatically detects the header row based on the content of the file.\n- The function processes the data to handle missing values, convert data types, and apply any specified transformations (like parsing dates).\n- Finally, it constructs and returns a DataFrame object populated with the parsed data, allowing for further data manipulation and analysis within the Pandas framework.",

This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to manipulate string data using file-like operations without the overhead of actual file I/O.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `StringIO` class can be initialized with an optional string argument that serves as the initial content of the buffer. If no argument is provided, it starts with an empty buffer.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- When an instance of `StringIO` is created, it initializes an internal buffer that can be manipulated using methods similar to those found in file objects, such as `read()`, `write()`, and `seek()`.\n- The `write()` method appends data to the buffer, while the `read()` method retrieves data from it. The `seek()` method allows users to change the current position within the buffer, enabling random access to the data.\n- The class is designed to handle string data efficiently, allowing for dynamic resizing of the buffer as needed.\n- `StringIO` does not have any external dependencies and operates solely within the context of string manipulation, making it a lightweight and efficient solution for in-memory text processing.",

The matrix must be square (i.e., the number of rows must equal the number of columns) and non-singular (i.e., it must have a non-zero determinant).\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The input `matrix` should be a square matrix represented as a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to a row of the matrix.\n- The matrix must be non-singular; otherwise, the function will raise an error. This means that the determinant of the matrix should not be zero.\n\n**Returns:**\n`List[List[float]]`: The inverse of the input matrix, represented as a two-dimensional list.

The semaphore can then be used to control access to these resources by allowing threads to acquire or release them.\n- The function does not have any internal dependencies, meaning it operates independently without relying on other functions or modules within the codebase.\n- Once the semaphore is created, it can be used in conjunction with other semaphore methods (such as `acquire` and `release`) to manage resource access effectively in a multi-threaded environment.",

It is commonly used in statistical analysis to determine the value below which a given percentage of observations fall, effectively allowing users to find critical values associated with various statistical distributions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `q` (`float`): A float representing the quantile or probability value, which must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive). This indicates the probability threshold for which the corresponding value is sought.\n- `loc` (`float`, optional): A float representing the location parameter of the distribution. This parameter shifts the distribution along the x-axis.\n- `scale` (`float`, optional): A float representing the scale parameter of the distribution. This parameter stretches or compresses the distribution along the x-axis.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `q` must be a float in the range (0, 1). Values outside this range will result in an error.\n- `loc` and `scale` are optional parameters. If provided, `scale` must be a positive float, while `loc` can be any float.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The value corresponding to the specified quantile for the distribution defined by the `loc` and `scale` parameters.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function first validates the input probability `q` to ensure it falls within the acceptable range (0, 1). If `q` is outside this range, an error is raised.\n- If the `scale` parameter is provided, it is checked to ensure it is a positive value, as a non-positive scale does not make sense in the context of probability distributions.\n- The function then applies the appropriate mathematical transformations based on the specified distribution type to compute the quantile value. This typically involves using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and its inverse.\n- The result is adjusted according to the `loc` and `scale` parameters, allowing for flexibility in the distribution's positioning and spread.\n- The function does not rely on any internal dependencies, making it a standalone utility for statistical calculations.",

This operation is commonly used in statistical analysis and machine learning, particularly in linear regression and other multivariate techniques, where the inversion of such matrices is required for parameter estimation.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `X` (`ndarray`): A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the input matrix. It is expected to have more rows than columns (i.e., more observations than features).\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The input matrix `X` should be a NumPy array with the shape (m, n), where \\( m \\) is the number of observations and \\( n \\) is the number of features. It is essential that \\( m \\) is greater than \\( n \\) to ensure that the matrix \\( X^T X \\) is invertible. Additionally, the matrix should not contain any singularities (i.e., it should not be rank-deficient).\n\n**Returns:**\n`ndarray`: The function returns the inverse of the matrix product \\( (X^T X)^{-1} \\) as a two-dimensional NumPy array. This matrix is used in various statistical computations, including the calculation of regression coefficients.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by calculating the matrix product of \\( X^T \\) (the transpose of matrix \\( X \\)) and \\( X \\) itself.\n- It then checks if the resulting matrix \\( X^T X \\) is invertible. If it is not invertible (i.e., if it is singular), the function may raise an error or return a specific value indicating failure.\n- Upon confirming that the matrix is invertible, the function computes the inverse using a suitable numerical method, such as Gaussian elimination or leveraging NumPy's built-in functions for matrix inversion.\n- The final output is the computed inverse matrix, which can be utilized in further statistical analyses or modeling tasks. \n\nThis function does not have any internal dependencies and operates solely on the provided input matrix.",

It first generates a CSV file containing sample data and then establishes a connection to a SQLite database. The function creates a table within the database and populates it with the data from the CSV file, facilitating the testing and demonstration of database operations.\n\n**Parameters:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The function does not require any input parameters. It operates independently, generating its own data and managing file and database creation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: The function does not return any value. Its purpose is to perform side effects by creating files and a database.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by checking if a directory exists for storing the generated CSV file. If it does not exist, it creates the necessary directory structure using `os.makedirs`.\n- It then generates a sample DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame`, which contains synthetic housing data.\n- The DataFrame is exported to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method, specifying the file path where the CSV will be saved.\n- After creating the CSV file, the function establishes a connection to a SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`. If the database file does not exist, it is created.\n- A cursor object is created from the database connection, which is used to execute SQL commands.\n- The function creates a new table in the database to store the housing data, using the `execute` method of the cursor to run the appropriate SQL command.\n- The data from the DataFrame is then inserted into the newly created table using the `to_sql` method, which facilitates the transfer of data from the DataFrame to the SQL table.\n- Finally, the function commits the transaction to ensure that all changes are saved, and it closes the database connection to release resources. Throughout the process, it handles potential errors related to file and database operations, ensuring robust execution.",

It serves as a structured representation of input data, ensuring that the necessary parameters for standard deviation computation are properly defined and validated.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `data` (`List[float]`): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated. This attribute is essential for the class's functionality.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `data` attribute should be a list containing numerical values (floats or integers). The list must not be empty, as standard deviation cannot be computed without at least one data point. Additionally, all elements in the list should be numbers to ensure valid calculations.\n\n**Returns:**\n`None`: The class does not return a value directly. Instead, it prepares the data for further processing, such as invoking methods that compute the standard deviation.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- Upon instantiation, `StdDevInput` initializes the `data` attribute with the provided list of numerical values.\n- The class may include methods to validate the input data, ensuring it meets the criteria for standard deviation calculation (e.g., checking for non-empty lists and numerical types).\n- The class is likely designed to work in conjunction with other components of the codebase that perform the actual computation of standard deviation, leveraging the structured input it provides.\n- It inherits from `BaseModel`, which may offer additional functionality or validation mechanisms, enhancing the robustness of the `StdDevInput` class. \n\nThis class is a foundational element in the overall architecture for statistical calculations, specifically focusing on standard deviation, and is intended to be used within a broader context of data analysis or mathematical modeling.",

However, the exact parameters are not specified in the provided context.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone (the class does not have a defined return value as it is a model class).\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- `LoanPaymentInput` inherits from the `BaseModel`, which means it benefits from the common behaviors and properties defined in the base class. This inheritance allows `LoanPaymentInput` to maintain consistency and reusability across the application.\n- The class is likely designed to encapsulate the necessary attributes for loan payment calculations, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and duration, although these specifics are not detailed in the provided context.\n- It may include methods for validating input data, performing calculations, or serializing the data for further processing.\n- The interaction with the `Field` class suggests that `LoanPaymentInput` may utilize field definitions to manage its attributes, ensuring that input data is handled consistently and correctly.",

It utilizes the net present value formula to determine the payment amount based on the loan's principal, annual interest rate, and the total number of payments.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `principal` (`float`): The total amount of the loan that needs to be repaid.\n- `annual_rate` (`float`): The annual interest rate expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).\n- `num_payments` (`int`): The total number of payments to be made over the life of the loan.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `principal` must be a positive float, indicating the loan amount.\n- `annual_rate` should be a non-negative float, where a value of 0.0 indicates no interest.\n- `num_payments` must be a positive integer, representing the number of payment periods.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The fixed payment amount that must be paid in each period to fully amortize the loan.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method first checks if the `annual_rate` is zero.

The validation logic within the class ensures that these samples are not identical, adhering to the requirements of an independent t-test.\n\n**Returns:**\n- **None**: The class does not return a value upon instantiation. Instead, it serves as a structured representation of the input data for the t-test.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `TTestInput` class inherits from the `BaseModel`, which provides a foundational structure for model instances. This inheritance allows `TTestInput` to utilize common behaviors and properties defined in `BaseModel`.\n- Upon instantiation, the class likely includes validation logic that checks the provided samples to ensure they are not identical. This is crucial for the validity of the t-test, as identical samples would violate the assumption of independence.\n- The class may also include methods for further processing or analysis of the samples, although specific methods are not detailed in the provided context.\n- The class does not have any internal dependencies beyond those inherited from `BaseModel`, making it a self-contained model focused on the requirements of the independent t-test.",

This is accomplished using the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` function, which checks the data type of each column.\n- If any column fails the numeric check, the method raises a `DataError`, providing feedback on which specific column(s) did not meet the validation criteria.\n- The method also checks for null values in the specified columns, raising a `DataError` if any null entries are found, thereby ensuring that the data is complete and valid for regression analysis.",

This function integrates input validation and correlation calculation, ensuring that the data provided is suitable for analysis before proceeding with the computation.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `data` (`list` or `array-like`): The dataset for which the correlation matrix is to be calculated. It should be structured as a two-dimensional array or DataFrame, where each column represents a different variable and each row represents an observation.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `data` parameter must be a two-dimensional structure containing numerical values. Each column should correspond to a variable, and all columns must have the same number of rows (observations). The dataset should not contain any missing values or non-numeric entries, as these would lead to errors during the correlation calculation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`np.ndarray`: A two-dimensional NumPy array representing the correlation coefficients between the variables in the dataset. Each element in the matrix indicates the correlation between a pair of variables, with values ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The function begins by utilizing the `validator.validate_correlation_inputs` to validate the input dataset. This step ensures that the data meets the necessary criteria for correlation analysis, including checks for non-empty datasets, equal lengths of input arrays, and numeric values.\n- If the validation passes, the function then calls `stats_svc.calculate_correlation_matrix`, which computes the correlation matrix based on the validated dataset. This function leverages statistical methods to determine the correlation coefficients, typically using Pearson's correlation.\n- The resulting correlation matrix is then returned as a NumPy array, providing a structured representation of the relationships between the variables in the dataset.\n- In the event of validation failure or any other errors during processing, the function raises an `APIException`, ensuring that errors are handled gracefully and informative messages are returned to the API client.",

This message is intended to inform the user or developer about the nature of the error.\n- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception. This code helps indicate the type of error that occurred (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `message` should be a non-empty string that clearly describes the error encountered.\n- `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically an integer within the range of 100 to 599, representing various categories of HTTP responses.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone: This method does not return a value.

This method analyzes the linear relationship between pairs of columns, providing insights into how closely related the data points are across the selected features.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `columns` (`List[str]`): A list of strings representing the names of the columns for which the correlation matrix will be calculated.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `columns` should be a non-empty list of strings, where each string corresponds to a valid column name in the dataset. The dataset must contain numerical data in these columns to compute the correlation.\n\n**Returns:**\n`Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]`: A nested dictionary representing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the specified columns. The outer dictionary's keys are the column names, and the values are dictionaries where each key is another column name and the value is the correlation coefficient.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by invoking `self._load_data`, which is responsible for loading the dataset into a DataFrame. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis.\n- Once the data is loaded, the method utilizes the `corr` function from the DataFrame to compute the correlation matrix specifically for the columns provided in the input list.\n- The resulting correlation matrix is then transformed into a dictionary format using the `to_dict` method, making it easier to access and interpret the correlation values.\n- The final output is a structured dictionary that allows users to quickly identify the correlation between each pair of specified columns, facilitating further data analysis and decision-making.",

This method utilizes the `npf.pmt` function to derive the payment amount, making it essential for financial modeling and planning.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `rate` (`float`): The interest rate for each period expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).\n- `nper` (`int`): The total number of payment periods in the loan or investment.\n- `pv` (`float`): The present value, or the total amount of the loan or investment. This can be negative if it represents an outgoing payment.\n- `fv` (`float`, optional): The future value, or the cash balance desired after the last payment.

This module is designed to provide essential financial calculations, leveraging the `numpy_financial` library to facilitate various financial analyses, such as calculating future values, present values, and periodic payments associated with loans and investments.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\nNone\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The methods within the `FinancialService` class expect input parameters that align with the requirements of the `numpy_financial` functions it utilizes. The following constraints apply:\n  - Interest rates must be non-negative floats.\n  - The number of periods (`nper`) must be a positive integer.\n  - Payment amounts (`pmt`) should be floats, which can be negative if they represent cash outflows.\n  - Present values (`pv`) and future values (`fv`) are optional floats, typically representing monetary amounts.\n  - The timing of payments (`when`) should be a string, either 'end' or 'begin'.\n\n**Returns:**\nThe methods of the `FinancialService` class return various float values, depending on the specific financial calculation being performed. These values represent key financial metrics such as future value, present value, or periodic payment amounts.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `module_code` encapsulates methods that call the `numpy_financial` functions to perform financial calculations. Each method is designed to validate its input parameters to ensure they meet the expected types and constraints before proceeding with calculations.\n- For future value calculations, the module utilizes the `npf.fv` function, which computes the future value of an investment based on periodic payments and a constant interest rate.\n- For present value calculations, it employs the `npf.pv` function to determine the current worth of future cash flows, discounted at the specified interest rate.\n- To calculate periodic payments, the module uses the `npf.pmt` function, which derives the fixed payment amount required to amortize a loan or investment over a specified number of periods.\n- The module does not maintain any internal state or attributes, focusing solely on providing utility methods for financial computations. Each method operates independently, relying on the input parameters provided by the user.",

This method is essential for financial analysis, allowing users to determine how much an investment will grow over time given specific parameters.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `rate` (`float`): The interest rate for each period, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).\n- `nper` (`int`): The total number of payment periods in the investment or loan.\n- `pmt` (`float`): The payment made each period; it cannot change over the life of the investment or loan.\n- `pv` (`float`, optional): The present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now. Defaults to 0 if not provided.\n- `when` (`str`, optional): Indicates when payments are due. Acceptable values are 'end' (default) for payments made at the end of each period, and 'begin' for payments made at the beginning of each period.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `rate` should be a non-negative float representing the interest rate per period.\n- `nper` must be a positive integer indicating the number of periods.\n- `pmt` should be a float representing the payment amount per period, which can be negative if it represents an outgoing payment.\n- `pv` is optional and should be a float, typically representing the current value of the investment or loan.\n- `when` should be a string that is either 'end' or 'begin', determining the timing of the payments.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The future value of the investment or loan after all payments have been made, considering the specified interest rate and payment schedule.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by validating the input parameters to ensure they meet the expected types and constraints.\n- It then calls the `npf.fv` function to calculate the future value using the provided parameters: interest rate, number of periods, payment amount, present value, and the timing of payments.\n- If payments are made at the beginning of each period, the function adjusts the future value calculation accordingly.\n- The final result is computed and returned as a float, representing the total future value of the investment or loan after the specified number of periods.\n- This method relies on the `npf.fv` function for its calculations, which performs the necessary arithmetic operations to derive the future value based on the financial parameters provided.",

This method leverages the `stats.ttest_ind` function from the SciPy library to perform the test, providing users with a robust statistical analysis tool for hypothesis testing.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `sample1` (`Union[List[float], np.ndarray]`): The first sample data, which can be provided as a list or a NumPy array containing numerical values.\n- `sample2` (`Union[List[float], np.ndarray]`): The second sample data, structured similarly to `sample1`.\n- `equal_var` (`bool`, optional): A flag that indicates whether to assume equal population variances. If set to `True`, the method uses the standard independent t-test; if `False`, it applies Welch's t-test, which is more appropriate when variances are unequal. The default value is `True`.\n- `alternative` (`str`, optional): Specifies the alternative hypothesis for the test. It can take one of the following values:\n  - `'two-sided'`: Tests if the means are different (default).\n  - `'less'`: Tests if the mean of `sample1` is less than the mean of `sample2`.\n  - `'greater'`: Tests if the mean of `sample1` is greater than the mean of `sample2`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- Both `sample1` and `sample2` should be array-like structures (lists or NumPy arrays) containing numerical data. They can vary in length.\n- The `equal_var` parameter should be a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.\n- The `alternative` parameter should be a string that matches one of the specified options.\n\n**Returns:**\n`Ttest_indResult`: An object that encapsulates the results of the t-test, including the t-statistic and the p-value, along with additional information about the test outcome.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by validating the input samples to ensure they are appropriate for statistical testing.\n- It calculates the means and variances of both samples.\n- Depending on the value of the `equal_var` parameter, the method either computes the standard t-test (assuming equal variances) or Welch's t-test (which does not assume equal variances).\n- The t-statistic is calculated based on the selected test, and the p-value is derived from this statistic in relation to the specified alternative hypothesis.\n- Finally, the method returns a `Ttest_indResult` object that contains the t-statistic and p-value, allowing users to interpret the significance of the results.",

It connects various models to the data layer, enabling thorough checks for data integrity and correctness.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `data_svc` (`DataService`): An instance of the `DataService` class that provides methods to interact with the database and retrieve data for validation purposes. This dependency is injected during the initialization of the `ValidationService`.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `ValidationService` expects a `DataService` instance to be passed during initialization. This instance should be capable of querying the database and returning data in a format suitable for validation.\n- The methods `validate_regression_inputs` and `validate_correlation_inputs` expect payloads of types `RegressionInput` and `CorrelationInput`, respectively. These payloads should contain the necessary attributes such as table names, column names, and paths to the database.\n\n**Returns:**\n- Both `validate_regression_inputs` and `validate_correlation_inputs` return `True` upon successful validation of the input data.\n- If validation fails, these methods raise a `DataError` with a descriptive message indicating the nature of the failure.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `ValidationService` class initializes with a `DataService` instance, which is used to fetch data from the database.\n- The `validate_regression_inputs` method performs the following steps:\n  1. It retrieves a DataFrame from the database using the provided database path and table name.\n  2. It checks that all specified variables (dependent and independent) exist in the DataFrame's columns.\n  3. It verifies that these columns are numeric and contain valid (non-null) data.\n  4. If any checks fail, it raises a `DataError` with an appropriate message.\n  \n- The `validate_correlation_inputs` method follows a similar process:\n  1. It retrieves the DataFrame from the database.\n  2. It checks for the presence of specified columns, ensuring that at least two numeric columns are available for correlation analysis.\n  3. It raises a `DataError` if any column is missing or not numeric.\n  \n- Both methods print success messages upon successful validation, indicating the completion of the validation process. The class effectively integrates model validation with data retrieval, ensuring robust data integrity checks across services.",

The standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. This method utilizes NumPy's `np.std` function to perform the calculation, allowing for adjustments based on the degrees of freedom.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `numbers` (`list[float]`): A list containing numerical data (integers or floats) for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.\n- `ddof` (`int`, optional): \"Delta Degrees of Freedom.\" This parameter adjusts the divisor used in the standard deviation calculation. The default value is `0`, which computes the population standard deviation. A value of `1` computes the sample standard deviation.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- `numbers` should be a list of numerical values (either integers or floats). The list must not be empty, as standard deviation cannot be computed from an empty dataset.\n- `ddof` should be a non-negative integer. If set to a value greater than the number of elements in `numbers`, it will raise an error.\n\n**Returns:**\n`float`: The standard deviation of the input list of numbers. This value represents the extent to which the numbers in the list deviate from the mean of the dataset.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method first validates the input list to ensure it contains numerical data and is not empty.\n- It then calls the `np.std` function, passing the list of numbers along with the specified `ddof` parameter. This function computes the standard deviation based on the provided data.\n- The result is a single float value representing the standard deviation, which indicates how spread out the numbers are in relation to their mean. The method does not modify the input list and returns the computed standard deviation directly.",

It facilitates the creation of a structured error handling mechanism that allows the API to return well-formed JSON error messages. This class serves as a foundation for defining various API-related exceptions, ensuring that all exceptions can be handled uniformly.\n\n**Parameters/Attributes:**\n- `status_code` (`int`): An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the exception (e.g., 404 for Not Found, 500 for Internal Server Error).\n- `detail` (`str`): A string providing a detailed message about the exception, which can be used to convey specific error information to the client.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `status_code` should be a valid HTTP status code, typically in the range of 100 to 599.\n- The `detail` should be a descriptive string that explains the nature of the error encountered.\n\n**Returns:**\nNone. The constructor initializes the exception instance but does not return a value.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The `APIException` class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class, allowing it to function as a standard exception.\n- Upon initialization, the constructor takes two parameters: `status_code` and `detail`. These parameters are assigned to instance attributes for later use.\n- The constructor then calls the superclass's (`Exception`) constructor with the `detail` message, which sets up the exception message that will be displayed when the exception is raised.\n- This class does not implement additional methods or properties beyond those inherited from `Exception`, but it provides a structured way to handle API errors consistently across the application.",

The function begins by validating the regression inputs using the `validate_regression_inputs` method from the `ValidationService`. This step ensures that the specified columns exist in the database and are numeric.\n2. If validation passes, the function retrieves the relevant data from the database using the `get_dataframe_from_sqlite` method, which loads the data into a DataFrame.\n3. It constructs the design matrix `X` by adding a column of ones (for the intercept) to the independent variables and extracts the dependent variable `y`.\n4. The function then performs OLS regression using NumPy's least squares method, calculating the coefficients and residuals.\n5. It computes various statistics, including the mean squared error, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values for each coefficient.\n6. Finally, it calculates the R-squared value to assess the goodness of fit for the model and compiles all results into a summary dictionary, which is returned to the caller. \n\nThis function integrates error handling through the `APIException` class, ensuring that any issues encountered during execution are communicated effectively to the API client.",

Z-Scores represent the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the dataset. This method is useful in statistical analysis for understanding how far away a particular value is from the average.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `numbers` (`list`): A list of numerical values (integers or floats) for which the Z-Scores will be calculated.\n\n**Expected Input:**\n- The `numbers` parameter should be a list containing numerical data. It is expected that the list has at least one element; otherwise, the calculation of mean and standard deviation will not be valid.\n\n**Returns:**\n`list`: A list of Z-Scores corresponding to each number in the input list. Each Z-Score indicates how many standard deviations the respective number is from the mean of the input list.\n\n**Detailed Logic:**\n- The method begins by converting the input list of numbers into a NumPy array for efficient numerical computations.\n- It then calculates the mean of the array using `np.mean`, which sums the elements and divides by the count of elements.\n- Next, it computes the standard deviation using `np.std`, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.\n- Finally, the method calculates the Z-Scores by subtracting the mean from each number and dividing the result by the standard deviation. This transformation standardizes the data, allowing for comparison across different datasets or scales.\n- The resulting Z-Scores are returned as a list, providing insights into the relative position of each number in the context of the overall dataset.",
