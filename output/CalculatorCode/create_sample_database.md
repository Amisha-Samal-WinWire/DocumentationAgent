## Overview
The `create_sample_database` function generates a sample SQLite database populated with housing data. It first creates a CSV file containing sample data, then establishes a SQLite database and populates it with the data from the CSV file.

## File Path
`create_db.py`

## Function Signature
```python
def create_sample_database():
```

## Description
This function performs the following tasks:
1. **Directory Creation**: It creates a directory named `data` if it does not already exist.
2. **CSV File Generation**: It generates a CSV file containing sample housing data, including:
   - `area_sqft`: Square footage of the houses.
   - `num_bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms in each house.
   - `age_years`: Age of the houses in years.
   - `price_usd`: Price of the houses in USD.
3. **Database Management**:
   - If a database already exists at the specified path, it is removed.
   - A new SQLite database is created.
4. **Data Insertion**: The function populates a table in the database with the data from the CSV file.
5. **Table Verification**: It verifies the successful creation of the table by checking the SQLite master table.
6. **Error Handling**: Any errors encountered during database operations are caught and printed.
7. **Connection Closure**: The database connection is closed at the end of the operation.
