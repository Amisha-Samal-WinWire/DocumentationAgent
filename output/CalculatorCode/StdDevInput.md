# Documentation for `StdDevInput`

```python
class StdDevInput(BaseModel):
    """Model for Standard Deviation calculation.

    Attributes:
        data (List[float]): A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation 
        will be calculated. The list must contain at least one element.

    Usage:
        To create an instance of StdDevInput, provide a list of float values:
        
        >>> std_dev_input = StdDevInput(data=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
        
    Note:
        Ensure that the 'data' attribute is populated with valid float numbers to 
        avoid errors during standard deviation computation.
    """
    data: List[float]
``` 

### Documentation Breakdown:

- **Class Purpose:** The docstring begins by clearly stating the purpose of the class, which is to model the input data required for standard deviation calculations.
  
- **Attributes Section:** This section describes the `data` attribute, specifying its type and purpose. It also includes a note about the requirement for the list to contain at least one element.

- **Usage Example:** An example is provided to illustrate how to instantiate the class, which aids users in understanding how to use it effectively.

- **Additional Note:** A cautionary note is included to inform users about the importance of providing valid float numbers in the `data` attribute, which helps prevent runtime errors.
