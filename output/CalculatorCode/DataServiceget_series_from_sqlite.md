# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_sqlite`

```python
def get_series_from_sqlite(self, db_path: str, table_name: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Reads a specific column from a SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series.

    This method retrieves a DataFrame from the specified SQLite database and table, 
    then extracts the specified column as a pandas Series. If the column does not 
    exist in the DataFrame, a `DataError` is raised to indicate the issue.

    Parameters:
    - db_path (str): The file path to the SQLite database.
    - table_name (str): The name of the table from which to read the column.
    - column_name (str): The name of the column to be extracted.

    Returns:
    - pd.Series: A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column.

    Raises:
    - DataError: If the specified column does not exist in the table.

    Example:
    >>> series = data_service.get_series_from_sqlite('path/to/database.db', 'my_table', 'my_column')
    >>> print(series)
    0    value1
    1    value2
    Name: my_column, dtype: object
    """
    df = self.get_dataframe_from_sqlite(db_path, table_name)
    if column_name not in df.columns:
        raise DataError(f"Column '{column_name}' not found in table '{table_name}'.")
    return df[column_name]
