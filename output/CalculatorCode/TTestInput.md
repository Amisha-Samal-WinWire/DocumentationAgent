# Documentation for `TTestInput`

```python
class TTestInput:
    """
    Model for an independent t-test. Validates that samples are not identical.

    This class is designed to handle the input for an independent t-test,
    ensuring that the two samples provided for comparison are not identical.
    The validation is crucial for the integrity of the t-test, as identical
    samples would invalidate the statistical assumptions of the test.

    Attributes:
        sample1 (list): The first sample for the t-test.
        sample2 (list): The second sample for the t-test.

    Methods:
        samples_must_not_be_identical(cls, v, values):
            Validates that sample2 is not identical to sample1.

### Explanation of Changes:
- The docstring has been expanded to include a brief overview of the class's purpose, attributes, and methods.
- The description clarifies the importance of the validation process in the context of an independent t-test.
- The attributes `sample1` and `sample2` are documented to provide users with an understanding of what data the class expects.
- The method `samples_must_not_be_identical` is mentioned in the context of its role in validation, aligning with the existing documentation style.
