# Documentation for `StatsService.calculate_standard_deviation`

```python
def calculate_standard_deviation(self, data: list) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

    The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion
    in a set of values. This method computes the standard deviation using NumPy's
    standard deviation function, which provides a fast and efficient way to
    calculate the standard deviation for a given dataset.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    data : list
        A list of numerical values for which the standard deviation is to be calculated.
        The list must contain at least one number.

    Returns:
    -------
    float
        The standard deviation of the input list. If the input list is empty,
        the function will return NaN (Not a Number).

    Examples:
    --------
    >>> stats_service = StatsService()
    >>> stats_service.calculate_standard_deviation([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    1.4142135623730951

    >>> stats_service.calculate_standard_deviation([10, 20, 30])
    10.0

    Notes:
    -----
    This method relies on the NumPy library. Ensure that NumPy is installed
    in your environment to use this function.
    """
    return float(np.std(data))
``` 

### Summary of Changes:
- Expanded the existing docstring to include detailed sections for parameters, return values, examples, and additional notes.
- Clarified the purpose and functionality of the method, including the implications of an empty input list.
- Provided example usages to illustrate how the function can be used in practice.
