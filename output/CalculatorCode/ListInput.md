# Documentation for `ListInput`

```python
class ListInput(BaseModel):
    """Model for operations on a list of numbers.

    This class is designed to represent a collection of numerical values 
    (specifically floats) that can be used for various mathematical 
    operations. It ensures that the list contains at least one number 
    through validation.

    Attributes:
        data (List[float]): A list of floating-point numbers. Must contain 
        at least one element.

    Example:
        >>> input_data = ListInput(data=[1.0, 2.5, 3.3])
        >>> print(input_data.data)
        [1.0, 2.5, 3.3]
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the provided list is empty.
    """
    data: List[float] = Field(..., min_length=1)
```
