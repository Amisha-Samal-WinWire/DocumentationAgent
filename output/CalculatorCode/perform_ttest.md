# Documentation for `perform_ttest`

```python
def perform_ttest(payload: TTestInput, service: StatsService=Depends(lambda: stats_service)):
    """
    Perform an independent two-sample t-test on the provided samples.

    This function handles a POST request to the '/test/independent_ttest' endpoint.
    It takes a payload containing two samples and utilizes the StatsService to 
    perform the statistical analysis. If the operation is successful, it returns 
    the results of the t-test along with the analysis type. In case of an error, 
    it raises an APIException with a 400 status code.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    payload : TTestInput
        An object containing two samples (sample1 and sample2) for the t-test.
    service : StatsService, optional
        An instance of StatsService, which provides the method to perform the t-test.
        This parameter is injected using FastAPI's dependency injection.

    Returns:
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary containing the analysis type and the results of the t-test.

    Raises:
    ------
    APIException
        If an error occurs during the t-test execution, an APIException is raised 
        with a status code of 400 and a detailed error message.

    Example:
    --------
    To perform a t-test, send a POST request to '/test/independent_ttest' with 
    a JSON body containing the two samples:
    
    ```json
    {
        "sample1": [1.2, 2.3, 3.1],
        "sample2": [2.1, 3.4, 4.2]
    }
    ```

    The response will include the analysis type and the results of the t-test.
    """
    try:
        results = service.perform_independent_ttest(payload.sample1, payload.sample2)
        return {'analysis_type': 'Independent Two-Sample T-Test', 'results': results}
    except Exception as e:
        raise APIException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```
