# Documentation for `cash_outflow_must_be_negative`

```python
def cash_outflow_must_be_negative(cls, v: float, info):
    """
    Validator to ensure that cash outflows are represented as negative values.

    This method enforces the financial convention that any cash outflow (such as payments or present value)
    must be represented as a negative number. If the provided value is positive, a ValueError is raised.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    cls : type
        The class that calls this method (typically used in class methods).
    v : float
        The value to be validated as a cash outflow.
    info : object
        An object containing metadata about the field being validated, including the field name.

    Returns:
    -------
    float
        The validated cash outflow value, which will be zero or negative.

    Raises:
    ------
    ValueError
        If the provided value `v` is greater than zero, indicating an invalid cash outflow representation.
    """
    # This validator enforces the financial convention that money you pay out (present value, payments)
    # should be represented as negative numbers.
    if v > 0:
        raise ValueError(f"'{info.field_name}' represents cash outflow and should be zero or negative.")
    return v
```
