# Documentation for `CorrelationInput.check_min_columns`

```python
def check_min_columns(cls, v):
    """
    Validate the number of columns specified for a correlation matrix.

    This class method checks if the provided value `v` (representing the columns)
    contains at least two elements. If `v` is not None and contains fewer than 
    two columns, a ValueError is raised with an appropriate message.

    Parameters:
    cls (Type[CorrelationInput]): The class that this method is bound to.
    v (Optional[List[Any]]): The value representing the columns to be validated.

    Returns:
    Optional[List[Any]]: The validated columns if the check passes.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If fewer than two columns are specified.
    """
    if v is not None and len(v) < 2:
        raise ValueError('At least two columns must be specified for a correlation matrix.')
    return v
