# Documentation for `RegressionInput.dependent_var_not_in_independent`

```python
def dependent_var_not_in_independent(cls, v, values):
    """
    Validates that the dependent variable is not included in the list of independent variables.

    This method is a class-level validator for the 'independent_vars' field. It checks if the 
    'dependent_var' is present in the provided independent variables. If it is, a ValueError 
    is raised to prevent the dependent variable from being mistakenly treated as an independent 
    variable.

    Args:
        cls: The class that this method belongs to.
        v (list): The list of independent variables being validated.
        values (dict): A dictionary containing other field values, including 'dependent_var'.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If 'dependent_var' is found in the list of independent variables.

    Returns:
        list: The validated list of independent variables.

    if 'dependent_var' in values.data and values.data['dependent_var'] in v:
        raise ValueError(f"The dependent variable '{values.data['dependent_var']}' cannot also be an independent variable.")
    return v
