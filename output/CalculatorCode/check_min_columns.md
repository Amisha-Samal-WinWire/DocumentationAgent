# Documentation for `check_min_columns`

```python
def check_min_columns(cls, v):
    """
    Validates that the input value contains at least two columns.

    This class method checks if the provided input `v` is not None and 
    ensures that its length is at least 2. If the length is less than 2, 
    a ValueError is raised with an appropriate message.

    Args:
        cls: The class that calls this method.
        v: The input value to be checked, which is expected to be a list or 
           similar iterable representing columns.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `v` is None or if the length of `v` is less than 2.

    Returns:
        The input value `v` if it meets the minimum column requirement.
    """
    if v is not None and len(v) < 2:
        raise ValueError("At least two columns must be specified for a correlation matrix.")
    return v
```
