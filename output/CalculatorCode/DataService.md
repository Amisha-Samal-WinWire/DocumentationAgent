# Documentation for `DataService`

```python
class DataService:
    """
    Service for loading data into pandas objects from files and databases.

    The DataService class provides methods to retrieve data from various sources, including
    CSV files and SQLite databases. It facilitates the extraction of entire tables or specific
    columns as pandas DataFrames or Series, respectively.

    Methods:
    --------
    get_dataframe_from_sqlite(db_path: str, table_name: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
        Retrieves an entire table from a SQLite database as a pandas DataFrame.

    get_series_from_file(file: UploadFile, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:
        Reads a CSV file, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series.

    get_series_from_sqlite(db_path: str, table_name: str, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:
        Retrieves a specified column from a SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> data_service = DataService()
    >>> df = data_service.get_dataframe_from_sqlite('path/to/database.db', 'my_table')
    >>> series = data_service.get_series_from_file(uploaded_file, 'column_name')
    >>> series_from_db = data_service.get_series_from_sqlite('path/to/database.db', 'my_table', 'my_column')
    """

    def get_dataframe_from_sqlite(self, db_path: str, table_name: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """
        Retrieve an entire table from a SQLite database as a pandas DataFrame.

        This function connects to a SQLite database specified by the `db_path` parameter,
        executes a SQL query to select all records from the specified `table_name`, 
        and returns the results as a pandas DataFrame. 

        If the database file does not exist, or if the specified table is empty or does not exist,
        a DataError is raised. This function is utilized by the ValidationService and StatsService.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        db_path : str
            The file path to the SQLite database.
        table_name : str
            The name of the table to retrieve data from.

        Returns:
        -------
        pd.DataFrame
            A pandas DataFrame containing the data from the specified table.

        Raises:
        ------
        DataError
            If the database file is not found, if the table is empty, or if any database error occurs.

    def get_series_from_file(self, file: UploadFile, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:
        """
        Reads a CSV file, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        file : UploadFile
            The uploaded CSV file from which to extract the column.
        column_name : str
            The name of the column to extract from the CSV file.

        Returns:
        -------
        pd.Series
            A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column.

        Raises:
        ------
        DataError
            If the uploaded file is not a CSV, if the specified column does not exist,
            or if there is an error processing the file.

        Example:
        --------
        >>> series = get_series_from_file(uploaded_file, 'column_name')
        >>> print(series)

        """
        Retrieves a specified column from a SQLite table and returns it as a pandas Series.

        This function connects to a SQLite database, reads the specified table, and extracts
        the data from the specified column. If the column does not exist in the table, a 
        DataError is raised.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        db_path : str
            The file path to the SQLite database.
        table_name : str
            The name of the table from which to retrieve the column.
        column_name : str
