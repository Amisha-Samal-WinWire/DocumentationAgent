# Documentation for `DataService.get_series_from_file`

```python
def get_series_from_file(self, file: UploadFile, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Reads a CSV file, extracts a specified column, and returns it as a pandas Series.

    This method takes an uploaded CSV file and a column name as input. It validates the file type,
    reads the content, and attempts to extract the specified column from the CSV. If the file is not
    a valid CSV or if the specified column does not exist, a `DataError` is raised.

    Parameters:
    - file (UploadFile): The uploaded CSV file to read.
    - column_name (str): The name of the column to extract from the CSV.

    Returns:
    - pd.Series: A pandas Series containing the data from the specified column.

    Raises:
    - DataError: If the file is not a CSV, if the column does not exist in the CSV, or if there is
      an error processing the file.

    Example:
    ```python
    try:
        series = data_service.get_series_from_file(uploaded_file, 'column_name')
    except DataError as e:
        print(e.detail)  # Handle the error appropriately
    ```

    Notes:
    - Ensure that the uploaded file is a valid CSV format.
    - The method reads the entire file into memory, which may not be suitable for very large files.
    """
    if not file.filename.endswith('.csv'):
        raise DataError('Invalid file type. Please upload a CSV file.')
    try:
        content = file.file.read().decode('utf-8')
        df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(content))
        if column_name not in df.columns:
            raise DataError(f"Column '{column_name}' not found in the CSV file.")
        return df[column_name]
    except Exception as e:
        raise DataError(f'Error processing file: {e}')
```
