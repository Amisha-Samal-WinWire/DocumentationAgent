# Documentation for `StatsService.perform_independent_ttest`

```python
def perform_independent_ttest(self, sample1, sample2):
    """
    Perform an independent two-sample t-test.

    This method computes the t-statistic and p-value for two independent samples 
    using the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function. The samples can be provided as 
    either lists or numpy arrays.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    sample1 : list or numpy.ndarray
        The first sample of data for the t-test.
    sample2 : list or numpy.ndarray
        The second sample of data for the t-test.

    Returns:
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - 't_statistic': The calculated t-statistic for the test.
        - 'p_value': The p-value associated with the t-statistic.

    Notes:
    -----
    The function assumes that the two samples have unequal variances 
    (Welch's t-test). If the samples are of different sizes, this method 
    is appropriate for determining if there is a significant difference 
    between the means of the two groups.

    Example:
    --------
    result = perform_independent_ttest([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
    print(result)  # Output: {'t_statistic': ..., 'p_value': ...}
    """
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(sample1, sample2, equal_var=False)
    return {'t_statistic': t_stat, 'p_value': p_value}
```
