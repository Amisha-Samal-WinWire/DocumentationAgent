# Documentation for `RegressionInput`

```python
class RegressionInput(BaseModel):
    """
    Model for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.

    This class is designed to ensure that the dependent variable is distinct from the independent variables 
    in a regression analysis. It validates that the dependent variable is not included in the list of 
    independent variables, preventing potential errors in the regression model setup.

    Attributes:
        table_name (str): The name of the table containing the data for regression analysis.
        dependent_var (str): The name of the dependent variable in the regression model.
        independent_vars (List[str]): A list of independent variables for the regression model. 
                                       Must contain at least one variable.
        db_path (str): The file path to the database containing the data. Defaults to 'data/sample_database.db'.

    Methods:
        dependent_var_not_in_independent(cls, v, values):
            Validates that the dependent variable is not included in the list of independent variables.

        Validates that the dependent variable is not included in the list of independent variables.

        This method checks if the 'dependent_var' is present in the provided list of independent variables. 
        If it is found, a ValueError is raised to prevent the dependent variable from being mistakenly treated 
        as an independent variable.

        Args:
            cls: The class that this method belongs to.
            v (list): The list of independent variables being validated.
            values (dict): A dictionary containing other field values, including 'dependent_var'.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If 'dependent_var' is found in the list of independent variables.

        Returns:
            list: The validated list of independent variables.
