# Documentation for `calculate_present_value`

```python
    def calculate_present_value(self, rate: float, nper: int, pmt: float, fv: float) -> float:
        """
        Calculates the present value of an investment.

        The present value (PV) is the current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows 
        given a specified rate of return. This function uses the net present value formula to compute 
        the present value based on the provided parameters.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        rate : float
            The interest rate per period (as a decimal). For example, a 5% interest rate should be 
            provided as 0.05.
        
        nper : int
            The total number of payment periods in the investment.
        
        pmt : float
            The payment made in each period. This amount does not change over the life of the investment.
        
        fv : float
            The future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made.

        Returns:
        -------
        float
            The present value of the investment, calculated using the provided parameters.

        Example:
        --------
        >>> pv = calculate_present_value(0.05, 10, -100, 1000)
        >>> print(pv)
        613.9132535407591
        """
        return npf.pv(rate=rate, nper=nper, pmt=pmt, fv=fv)
``` 

### Summary of Changes:
