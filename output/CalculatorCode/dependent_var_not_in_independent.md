# Documentation for `dependent_var_not_in_independent`

```python
def dependent_var_not_in_independent(cls, v, values):
    """
    Validator to ensure that the dependent variable is not included in the list of independent variables.

    This method checks if the 'dependent_var' is present in the provided `values` and verifies that it 
    is not part of the list `v`, which represents independent variables. If the dependent variable is 
    found in the list of independent variables, a ValueError is raised.

    Args:
        cls: The class that this method belongs to.
        v (list): A list of independent variables.
        values (dict): A dictionary containing the data for validation, including the 'dependent_var'.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the dependent variable is found in the list of independent variables.

    Returns:
        list: The original list of independent variables if validation passes.
    """
    if 'dependent_var' in values.data and values.data['dependent_var'] in v:
        raise ValueError(f"The dependent variable '{values.data['dependent_var']}' cannot also be an independent variable.")
    return v
``` 

### Explanation of Documentation:
- **Purpose:** The docstring clearly states the function's purpose, which is to validate that the dependent variable is not included in the independent variables.
- **Arguments:** Each argument is described, including its type and purpose.
- **Exceptions:** The conditions under which a ValueError is raised are specified.
- **Return Value:** The return value is documented, indicating that the original list is returned if validation is successful.
