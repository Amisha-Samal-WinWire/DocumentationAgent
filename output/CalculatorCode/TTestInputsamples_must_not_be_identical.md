# Documentation for `TTestInput.samples_must_not_be_identical`

```python
def samples_must_not_be_identical(cls, v, values):
    """
    Validate that the two samples provided for a t-test are not identical.

    This method is a class method decorated with `@field_validator` for the 
    'sample2' field. It checks if the value of 'sample2' is identical to 
    'sample1'. If they are the same, a ValueError is raised, indicating that 
    the two samples cannot be identical for a valid t-test.

    Parameters:
    cls (Type): The class that this method belongs to.
    v (Any): The value of 'sample2' being validated.
    values (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing the values of other fields, 
                             including 'sample1'.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If 'sample2' is identical to 'sample1'.

    Returns:
    Any: The validated value of 'sample2' if it is not identical to 'sample1'.
