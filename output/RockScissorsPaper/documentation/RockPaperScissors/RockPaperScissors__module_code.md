### module_code

**Description:**
The `module_code` serves as the main entry point for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It orchestrates the flow of the game by integrating various components, including user input, random choice generation, and determining the winner based on the players' selections. This module is designed to provide an interactive gaming experience in a command-line interface.

**Parameters/Attributes:**
None

**Expected Input:**
- The module expects user input in the form of a string representing the player's choice (either "rock", "paper", or "scissors"). The input is handled through the `textWahl` function, which validates the input before proceeding with the game logic.

**Returns:**
None

**Detailed Logic:**
- The module begins by clearing the console using the `clear` function to provide a fresh display for the game.
- It prompts the user to make a choice using the `textWahl` function, which ensures that the input is valid and provides feedback to the player.
- The module then generates a random choice for the computer using the `randomChoice` function, ensuring a fair game.
- It compares the player's choice with the computer's choice by calling the `whoWins` function, which determines the outcome of the game.
- Based on the result, the module may display a message indicating whether the player won, lost, or if the game was a tie.
- Finally, the module concludes the game by calling the `goodbye` function, which provides a farewell message to the user before exiting the program. 

This structure allows for a seamless and engaging user experience, leveraging the functionalities of the various dependencies to create a complete Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
