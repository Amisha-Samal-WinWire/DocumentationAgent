### randomChoice() -> str

**Description:**
The `randomChoice` function selects a random option from a predefined list of choices, typically used in games like Rock-Paper-Scissors. It leverages randomness to ensure that the selection is unpredictable, simulating a fair game scenario.

**Parameters:**
- None

**Expected Input:**
- The function does not take any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on a predefined list of choices that are hardcoded within the function. The choices typically include options like "rock," "paper," and "scissors."

**Returns:**
`str`: A randomly selected choice from the predefined list of options.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `randint` function from an external library to generate a random integer that corresponds to an index in the list of choices.
- It first defines a list containing the possible choices.
- Then, it generates a random index within the bounds of the list length.
- Finally, it returns the choice at the randomly generated index, ensuring that each option has an equal probability of being selected. This randomness is crucial for the fairness of the game.
