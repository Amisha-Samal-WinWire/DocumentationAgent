### clear() 

**Description:**
The `clear` function is designed to clear the console screen, providing a clean slate for user interaction in a command-line interface. This is particularly useful in applications like games, where a fresh display can enhance the user experience by removing previous outputs.

**Parameters:**
None

**Expected Input:**
None. The function does not require any input parameters.

**Returns:**
None. The function does not return any value.

**Detailed Logic:**
- The function utilizes the `system` method from an external library to execute a command that clears the console screen.
- The specific command executed depends on the operating system: typically, it uses `cls` for Windows and `clear` for Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS).
- This ensures that the console is cleared effectively across different environments, enhancing the usability of the application. 

By calling this function, users can expect a refreshed console view, which is particularly beneficial in interactive applications such as games or command-line tools.
